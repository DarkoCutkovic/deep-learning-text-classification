                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           dear mr husar , first off i would like to congratulate your representatives and also our representatives that they have come to the agreement of joining forces and starting a joint venture .  i am confident that this is going to be a fruitful working - together for reaching both ,  our and your ,  long - term goals .  as far as i am informed this cooperation can not only bring you short - term and mid - term benefits :  it also helps to enhance your region by improving infrastructure and might ease your market access to western european markets yielding long - term chances for your organization . unfortunately ,  time is pressing ,  but i am looking forward to discussing with you the following ,  really important aspects of the agreed - upon joint - venture : secrecy termsas you have certainly been briefed ,  the technology we will be sharing in this joint venture is essential for the new blue star engine ,  an engine which is compared to current state - of - the - art engines extremely economic friendly .  it generates extremly low toxic emissions and we have been able to reduce kerosene consumption significantly .  the process of research and development has been very ressource intensive .  however ,  we see a huge potential in this technology .  the main enabler for this engine is in particular the technology ,  which is the reason why we see the technology itself as the most valuable good we are bringing into this joint venture . we are thankful for your agreement on installing new security software at your cost .  i am certain that this is not only important for the jointventure ,  but in times of recurring security issues with modern data information systems this will also be helpful for your future operations . we see it of utmost importance that we agree on a secrecy clause with the following terms : metallurg technologies is prohibited from giving access to any third party . metallurg technologies is not allowed to use the combustion chamber in any other products . the blue star technology may only be used with the express permission of mihalits agsplit of  #  of directors in boardwe have already agreed on the number of directors in the board of our joint venture .  considering the know - how and resources we are investing in this combined project we expect to have a split of one  :  four  ( metallurg technologies  :  mihalits ag )  directors in the board .  we have a long - standing ,  strong experience in running jointventures of this size ,  this is why you can rely on our expertise of managing this undertaking . split of future revenueswe think it is reasonable that the share each party in this jointventure invested ,  also receives in future revenues .  our finance department has crunched the numbers and identified an investment from us  ( mihaltis ag )  of  €  eighty mio in the joint venture over the time - span of five years .  we identified a span of investment by your party of  €  twenty - twenty-three . five mio . we are providing this new ,  outstanding technology ,  which will with its most promising innovation in airline engine design in recent years change the world of aviation engines .  we are of the opinion that a twenty  -  eighty  %  split  ( metallurg technologies  :  mihalits ag )  is in consideration of our huge quantitative and qualitative investment in both of our interests and can be considered to be very fair . court of jurisdictionas part of a legal agreement on jointventures we have seen in the past that agreeing on the location of court jurisdiction is important .  the austrian body of corporate law is known to be very comprehensive and has been proven several centuries .  in contrast ,  to our knowledge ukrainian corporate law is still somewhat younger .  this is why we propose austria being the court of jurisdiction for handling all legal issues  -  we do not expect that any of these issues arise ,  but for ensuring legal safety for both us . duration of contractunfortunately ,  our companies have not worked together in recent years .  for every new jointventure with two parties not having a lot of experience working together ,  we think that keeping the years of binding one to another on fixed agreements should be kept to an extend which is foreseeable .  in this case we propose fixing the agreement on a time span of five years . with these above points ,  i would like to conclude our opening offer . i am looking forward to your response and i am eager to answer any questions you have . yours sincerely , kim koller dear mr koller , in the first place ,  it is an honor to me and the whole company starting a joint venture with such an well - known aircraft manufacturer as you are to gain international competitive advantage .  even though we both have different problems in different areas ,  iam looking positively in the future regarding our profits and working environment .  apart from our issue in the area of development of new infrastructure ,  it is a big opportunity for you to develop the new engine called blue star and in the other hand to improve your financial situation by gaining competitive advantage through establishing the new engine .  nevertheless we cant skip the major part of the joint venture ,  namely to discuss the conditions of the agreed - upon - joint - venture .  surely we will come to a result ,  which leads to an win - win situation .  secrecy termswe as metallurg technologies are acquainted about your technology and its advantages regarding to extremely low toxic emissions and are convinced of the fact .  on the other hand the engine is your only hope to survive .  basically it depends on us whether we finance the technology . at the same time your engine is the only aspect from which we can benefit .  due to the fact that our main goal is to gain global competitive advantage we want to use the combustion chamber in different products as well .  certainly we can agree on a secrecy clause with the following terms . one .  metallurg technologie is prohibited from giving access to any third partytwo .  the blue star technology may only be used with the express permission of mihalits ag but not only for one product number of directorsdue to your know - how ,  strong experience and resources we accept to have split of a one : four  ( metallurg technologies  :  mihaltis ag )  directors in the board .  in return ,  we expect you to respond to our information accordingly .  split of future revenuesas a matter of course the aim of the joint venture is not only to make friends but also to make profit .  your point of investing  €  eighty mio is incomprehensible .  at this point in time you cannot assign a clear value to the technology ,  because you didnt show us how the new engine will look like yet .  obviously the value of the innovation is not more than  €  sixty mio due to lack of technical information .  in addition there is a possible risk of failure .  on our side we can give a clear overview of financial costs .  in the one hand to build three new plants will cost about  € twenty-four mil .  in the other hand we estimate costs of r & d to be about  €  seven . two mil and production costs about  €  ten mil .  furthermore we have already installed new security software and agreed to pay a part of the costs for upgrading the transportation and electricity infrastructure in the region ,  which will lead to advantages for both .  as a whole we need to gain up to eighty %  of future revenues to cover our fixed costs of production and secondly to turn a profit .  court of jurisdictionour opinion according to resolve this topic is really simple and clear .  as you want to set up a joint venture in ukraine with a ukranian company ,  seems to be intelligibly that the venture will be subject to ukranian law .  duration of contracti think we bot will have ups and downs ,  but especially in the beginning we will have tough times .  the reason why is to adapt the new product and its revolutionary technology to the customers and the society regarding to environmental aspects .  but to achieve the goal of our both successfully namely to gain long term competitive advantage we need to ensure a future - oriented cooperation over a period of twelve years .  i am looking forward to hear back from you and hope that we can achieve our goals . yours sincerely , marian husar ninety-six normal zero twenty-one false false false de x - none x - none  < w : lsdexception dear mr husar , thank you for your clarifications .  we now understand what is important to you and would like to send you an improved ,  surely more appealing offer . duration of contractwe see your point of wanting a longer duration of the fixed contract .  however ,  we simply cannot exceed the duration of contract of eight years .  few members of our management are urging to sell our developed technology to asian partners and not starting this joint venture with you .  by taking a contract over eight years ,  we can please these partners and convince them to still pursue a eight year - long trial with you .  if we together make it through the first difficult five years successfully  -  which we are very sure of !   -  our management will be very happy to extend the contract even after the eight years . share of future revenueconcerning the split of future revenues ,  i  -  again  -  need to emphasise the aspect of all the research and development we have done so far on the bluestar technology .  as outlined in my initial offer we have invested so far  €  eighty mio .  in personnel ,  material costs and excessive testing .  there is not further excessive research needed ;  we are expecting  €  four . five mio r & d costs on your side  -  compared to the  € seven . two mio you are describing .  furthermore ,  especially in the first five years considering the number of sales we are expecting ,  we strongly suggest that the construction of max .  two new construction plants are required and that one of your old plants is modified slightly . furthermore ,  we have compared price levels for production in austria and ukraine ,  with much higher levels in austria .  the actual price for production would amount to  €  ten mio for production in austria .  it is unclear to us how you came to the conclusion of production costs amounting to  €  ten mio at our joint - venture plants  -  we are expecting at the highest  €  six . five mio for production ,  but to be honest  -  we don ' t exactly know your cost structure so far .  this is why ,  we estimate here another  €  zero . five mio extra . summing the expenditures for you side up  ( two  ' new '  plants ,  modifications for old one  ( zero , four )   :  eight * two . four =   € nineteen . two mior & d costs max  € four . five mioproduction costs :   € six . five mio  +   € zero . five mio  =   € seven miototal :   € thirty . seven mio costs for your side  +  risk  (~ fifteen %  chance of loss ):   € four . six mio  =   € thirty-five . three miocompared to our investment of  € eighty mio  ( costs )   +  risk  (~ fifteen %  chance of loss )   =   € ninety-two miobased on these numbers we arrive at a fair split of seventy-two %   :  twenty-eight %   [ mihalits  :  metallurg ]. as a sign of our dedication and trust in this partnership we agree on lowering this share to sixty-seven %  for us ,  resulting in a one third share for your company . please bear in mind that the stated amounts above are solely the numbers of our joint - venture .  it is important to have a broader look on the investments you have agreed on with your government to improve massively your region .  these improvements are very probable to increase your presence in the ukraine ,  allow lower costs of production and will help you for sure to enter more partnerships with neighboring companies . court of jurisdictionconcerning the location of court of jurisdiction we do not see the point in a bureaucratic court having a negative influence on our joint venture .  especially for larger companies and larger undertakings such as our joint - venture the austrian corporate law is very generous ,  also in terms of taxes .  we are very confident that our legal team will be able to handle this case and work together successfully with your legal associates .  however ,  if you are agreeing with all other terms outlined above ,  we are willing to find a compromise for this issue ,  such as choosing country with similar legal standards  -  for example germany .  please respond in form of a counter offer if you do . unfortunately ,  we only have one day left .  we are confident that our both parties can agree on the stated terms above . yours sincerely , kim koller dear mr kim koller , first of all i am glad to see that you are convinced to compromise and realise the joint venture ,  so am i .  anyway your offer is in total unbalanced and unfair .  i am trying to accommodate you but it is still from my part too biased .  with this last offer i would like to propose the final conditions .  otherwise this joint venture cannot be realised .   & middot ;  share of future revenuesi appreciate you detailed cost analysis .  to sum up we got huge costs to bear .  these are as i have already mentioned with numbers :  the building of three new plants ,  costs of r & d ,  installation of new security software and upgrading of the transformation and electricity infrastructure in the region .  our costs that you have analysed are not traceable .  we need at least forty %  of the revenues to cover our fixed costs .  but i told you our and of course the goal of our both to make long - term profits and not only to cover our fixed costs .  there is no doubt that you will achieve success by realising your technology and by cooperating with us and so do we in the future .  nevertheless we must be sure that our fixed costs will be covered and moreover that we will make profit as well .  i am sorry to say that we cant corporate and set up a joint venture if you dont agree to our split of future revenues .   & middot ;  duration of contractdue to the fact that you have to convince your business partners we can enter into a compromise .  the duration of contract of eight years provides a basis to cooperate and take advantages for our both .  that is why we agree on a duration of contract of eight years .& middot ;  court of jurisdictionwe both do not have experience regarding to start a business in a different country .  due to the fact that you want to corporate with us as an ukrainian company are still not willing to subject to ukrainian law .  it seems that we both are convinced about our court of jurisdiction .  for this reason it is a neutral solution to choose a third ,  more neutral country namely germany without anyone being disadvantaged .  in the end i would like to point out to you again that i have accepted two of your conditions so far .  these are the number of directors and the secrecy clause and you havent taken one yet .  infortunately the joint venture cannot be realized if you dont accept the above conditions .  ninety-six normal zero twenty-one false false false de x - none x - none  < w : lsdexception locked =\" false \"  priority =\" sixty-five \"  name =\" medium list one acc dear mr .  husar , i am glad that we are both of the opinion that at some point we have to find ourselves in the middle of our  ' extreme '  positions .  this was the case for the court of jurisdiction ,  but also for the duration of the contract . however ,  we are not able to agree on a split of future revenues forty %  mihaltis  :  sixty %  metallurg .  i find it very unfortunate that our cost findings are  ' not traceable '  to you and that you are not  ( trying to )  bring light into this the issue .  in the short term i am aware that it will be difficult to cover fixed costs .  but i need to push this issue once more :  this joint - venture will bring much more than simply making some revenues .  it allows you a stronger strategic position in western europe ,  it allows you to share the costs for improving the entire infrastructure in your region and it finally allows you to make profits in the mid - term based on a completly new technology ,  which you did not have to develop ,  test and take the risk of developing it yourself .  moreover ,  we think that you are overestimating your costs  -  especially the number of production sites to be built as outlined in my previous offer  ( max .  two new plants ,  one old one can be adapted ). in the end ,  we have two options to come to an agreement : we share revenues fifty : fifty ,  four members on directors board  ( for us ),  eighty duration of contract ,  with a secrecy clause and germany as the court of jurisdictionwe share revenues forty : sixty  ( us :  forty ,  you : sixty ),  five members on directors board  ( for us ),  eighty duration of contract ,  with a secrecy clause and germany as the court of jurisdictionthis current offer holds the terms of the second one .  if you prefer number one ,  please send me a counter offer . we are very much looking forward to your decision on between these two options . yours sincerely , kim koller dearr mr kim koller , on the one hand it makes me glad to see your effort in trying to realize the joint venture but on the hand you still haven ' t agreed on any conditions of us . last night we had a final meeting regarding to our cooperation .  we have discussed about your offer and come to a result as our company metallurg technologies . first of all as i told you in my last offer ,  we are still convinced that even your current offer is too one - sided .  especially since as i ' ve come to meet you at certain points ,  like court of jurisdification ,  members on directors board and even to agree on a secrecy clause . now i am going to make our final offer in the interests of the whole company . we are definitively aware of the fact that this joint venture will be successful in the future .  nevertheless there are risks to bear as i told you with facts ,  especially on our part .  we can ' t afford any faiulure .  based on the worst case namely the failure of this joint venture ,  there will be negative economicly consequences for the citizens of ukraine ,  which we can never account for .  as a result the coniditions of this joint venture has to be fair . i hope you understand this and have goodwill for the following options : one .  first option is still the same offer . two .  we share revenues fifty : fifty ,  two members on director ' s board  ( for us ),  eighty duration of contract ,  with a secrecy clause and germany as the court of jurisdictionat the end i still have hope that you will accept the offer .  oterwhise this joint venture can not be realized .  i am looking forward to cooperate with you .  if not we still wish you all the best for the future with your technology . yours sincerely , marian husar dear mr husar , this is the same offer you posted earlier which we would like to accept ,  please agree on it for the fulfilment of this negotiation . yours sincerely , kim koller   \n",
      "1    dear h .  husar ,  on behalf of mihalits ag ,  i would like to thank you for your willingness to take part in this online negotioation ,  to explore the possibilities for our joint venture .  i am looking forward to our collaboration to negotiate on an outcome that both parties will be satisfied with .  considering our two - week time range ,  i would like to present to you my first offer .  in preliminary negotiations our colleagues were able to agree on the duration of the contract with a minimum of five years duration of contract five  .  also an arrangement has been made on a five member board .  we would like the contribution of mihalits ag’s directors on the board to be four mihalits directors in board four  .  in order to push the development of the blue star engine ,  mihalits ag will sent some of our key engineers to your plants in the ukrain .  we would like metallurg thechnologies to pay one hundred %  for the workers and staff hired especially for our joint venture payment of workers hired for the jv metallurg  .  the level of wages of all ukrainian workers is also important to us .  we feel that all ukrainian workers working on the joint venture production should be paid an additional twenty %  additional compensation ukrainian workers twenty  .  focussing on the share of future revenue ,  mihalits ag would want a eighty - twenty %  split of which eighty %  would be mihalits ag ' s share mihalits share of future revenue eighty  .  finally mihalits ag would like metallurg technologies to sign a secrecy clause ,  to certify the secrecy of our blue star technology secrecy clause yes  .  of course mihalits ag wants to cooperate with the best intentions ,  but in any case we need some sort of legal option .  in case something would go wrong ,  mihalits ag would like all legal issues to be discussed in austrian courts court of jurisdiction austria  .  i hope i have informed you enough so far .  if you have any questions ,  feel free to ask .  please consider my proposal and i look forward to hearing .  best regards ,  mrs .  koller dear mrs .  koller ,  thank you for your opening proposal !  first of all i would like to tell you that all involved parties of metallurg technologies and lviv ,  ukraine are looking forward to the at issue collaboration with your impressive company .  to reach the goal of an sustainable collaboration we consider mutual respect ,  trust and fairness as absolutly nessecary .  for that reason i think that all parties should besides seeing their own advantages also consider the other parties needs to benefit from that joint venture .  because of that your propal is very far from an basis that metallurg would consider as negotiable .  to discuss and understand these mutual needs i would suggest to talk about the different issues point by point .  what metallurg is cocerned about is the secrecary clause .  we are not reluctant towards this topic but we can ' t really understand your need to have a clause like that .  as i explained before we see trust as a necessity for a stable collaboration .  having such an secrecy clause meens an removal of trust to us .  maybe you can explain the background of that topic to me ,  so that i understand your need that stands beside that clause .  this would be the first step to build that negotiation on a fundament of trust .  i ' m looking forward to hearing from you soon !  best regards mr .  husar dear mr .  husar ,  first of all let me thank you for your kind and quick responce .  i absolutely agree on your point of view that our collaboration should be one of mutual repect and trust .  it was never my intention to give you the impression that mihalits ag doesn’t consider you as a trustworthy partner in this joint venture .  of course we should both benefit from this ,  and meet eachothers needs .  so maybe you can give me some more information about the needs and standards of metallurge technologies ,  so we can discuss this issue in a broader perspective and come to a mutual agreement ,  because this negotiation is more than the sum of its parts .  of course we are proud of our advanced blue star - technology and strongly believe in its succes .  if any competitive company would get their hands on this technology and therefor could be the first to market this engine ,  it would have adverse consequences for the both of us and our joint venture .  i hope i have answered your question sufficiently .  have a nice weekend .  best regards ,  mrs .  koller dear mrs .  koller ,  from you explanation i understand that you don ' t trust metallurg not to transfer information about blue star - technology to competitors .  as we also have an incentive not to do so i don ' t think that a secrecy clause would not be necessary in a good collaboration .  what do you think about that ?  moreover i have a big concern about your offer .  especially the issues mihalits directors in board four  ,  mihalits share of future revenue eighty and payment of workers hired for the jv metallurg  .  i don ' t think that this offer can be basis for a fair collaboration where both parties have equal rights .  why do you think that mihalis inserts more into the collaboration than metallurg does ?  best regards ,  mr .  husar dear mr .  husar ,  i understand you have some concerns about our full - offer .  i am willing to meet you in this .  so i would like to ask what your terms are on the issues you mentioned ,  so i am able to make any concessions .  maybe if we come to an agreement on these issues ,  you are able to see that we also want this joint venture to have a fair and reasonable outcome for us both ,  and we can show you our trust .  perhance than you also have another position towards signing the secrecy clause ,  and we can discuss this issue in a new light later on .  best regards ,  mrs .  koller dear mrs .  koller ,  i think that metallurg willl have to invest a big amount of money ,  if we start this jv ,  that is even higher than the value of the technology you bring in .  so an twenty %  share of future revenues for us is absolutly unimagineable and not even a basis for a negotiation .  for the same reason majoity of metallurgs directors in board is absolutely neccesary .  as we are already bearing the majority of the burden of the human resource costs i can ' t consider an offer were metallurg also has to pay the workers hired for the jv as fair or even as loyal .  to be on a level that we can negotiate about is an absolut precondition for a negotiation of that jv ,  so i would suggest that you sent an offer that is worth discussing for both companies .  after that i will sent our offer and we have a basement for a negotiation .  in fact we will not have a valueable and cooperative discussion if one of our companies does not have the nessecary respect for the counterpart .  best regards ,  mr .  husar dear mr .  husar ,  i understand that the investments of metallurg technologies are high .  and of course we appreciate the investments you have already made .  but according to our calculations your investment shouldn’t be higher than the investments mihalist did on the development of the blue - star technology .  now i understand why you considered our offer as unfair .  maybe you can explain how your share of the investments is calculated ?  our offer on the future revenues was based on the calculations of our finance department ,  which concluded that we had an investment of seventy-six , five %  and your investment would than be twenty-three , five %.  therefor we didn’t consider our proposal as unfair .  based on this data ,  we would like to meet you on a seventy-six , five %- twenty-three , five %  split .  the same goes for the next issue ,  the number of directors on board .  i can understand your reasoning ,  that if metallurg technologies is the biggest investor ,  you should get the majority of directors on board and you don’t want to expand your costs on human resource by paying the workers hired for the joint venture .  because mihalits ag ,  based on our calculations ,  is the biggest investor in this joint venture i can’t make any further consession yet .  depending on your information on the investements you made ,  these issues will of course be negotiable .  i hope you understand where our offer is based on and you are willing to give me some information on what would be a reasonable offer for metallurg technologies and why .  i hope we can come to a better understanding of both party’s positions ,  because i would like this collaboration to work .  best regards ,  mrs .  koller dear mrs .  koller ,  thank you for describing your position .  but i can not agree with your issues .  one .  as we don ' t speak about past investment but about values and futre investments to bring into the jv ,  it would be better to consider the value of the technology you bring in .  as this value can only be estimated when observing the market ,  we made a bountiful estimation as we don ' t want to estimate the value of blue star lower than it is .  we estimate that blue star has a present value of  €  sixty million .  so that is what you bring into the jv .  if we access a joint venture we will have to build three new plants for about twenty-four million ,  there will be r & d costs and production costs of about thirty million and investments in security systems of roughly fifteen million ,  as well as investments in local infrastructure of about thirty-five million .  as you also want a compensation of our ukrain workers ,  which we also will have to pay ,  we should consider this costs two .  all in all the allocation of assets will be about thirty-seven %  on mihalitis side and sixty-three percet on our side when we do not consider the compensation of workers .  for that reason i would suggest :  mihalits share of future revenue thirty-five and additional compensation ukrainian workers ten  .  two .  as metallurg provides the bigger asset in this jv and also has a good relationship to local authorities and local partners ,  which will help to achieve the goals of both companies ,  i suggest :  mihalits directors in board one three .  to be on a neutral level of jurisdication i would suggest to have the court of jurisdiction in an country that is not ukraine or austria :  court of jurisdiction germany four .  to have a lasting relationship i would suggest to have a longer duration of the contact :  duration of contract twelve five .  as we already bearing the majority of the burden of the human recource costs in his project we think that mihaltis should pay the workers hiredfor this jv .  payment of workers hired for the jv mihalits six .  the issue secrecy clause is a topic we don ' t really like .  i think that a secracy clause will shorten the trust in this jv .  secrecy clause no  .  i did not yet heard an argument besides ones that has todo with issues of distrust .  if you can convince me that there are other reasons than distrust for that clause i will have no problem to have this clause in the contract .  i hope we now can negotiate on a level that is more adjusted to the needs of both sides .  best wishes mr .  husar dear mr .  husar ,  thank you for sending me your offer .  i definitely see oppertunities to come to an agreement on some issues .  for instance the court of jurisdiction ,  in which i could relate to your argument and i could only consider it as fair that the court of jurisdiction should be on neutral ground court of jurisdiction germany furthermore ,  i understand from your messages that you are concerned about the costs you’ve already made and the additional costs of the workers in this joint venture .  we can lower the extra costs of the workers ,  to meet you in a shared payment of the workers hired for this joint venture payment of workers hired for the jv halfhalf and ask for a additional payment of the ukranian workers of ten %  additional compensation ukrainian workers ten  .  as we compensate the costs for the human recourses ,  i think it would be reasonable that share of future revenue should be at least seventy-five %  for mihalits ag mihalits share of future revenue seventy-five  .  unfortunately i can’t agree with you on your suggestion of one director of mihalits ag on the board .  to push the production of the blue - star technology in the right direction i think it is necessary to bring in our knowlegde of this technology through having the majority of the directors on board .  but because we also value your network of local authorities and partners we are prepared to lower our offer to three directors on board mihalits directors in board three and finally ,  i have trouble understanding your resistance towards signing the secrecy clause ,  because you have already spent fifteen million on a security system to secure this project so our competition is not able to get their hands on this technology ,  what would have severe consequences for our joint venture .  i hope you can understand that we benefit both from this secrecy clause secrecy clause yes  .  best regards ,  mrs .  koller dear mrs .  koller ,  you are right that there are some points where opportunities to come to an agreement can be seen .  but especially at the share of future there are huge differences .  in fact i can ' t see an argument for your account of getting seventy-five %  of future revenues .  you also misunderstood me that we worry about costs we had in the past ,  i always speak about future invetsments that have to be done if we start a jv .  for that reason we can compare mutual investments in the jv ,  which is the blue star technology on your side and all i have described in the previous message .  honestly i can tell you that a share of value under sixty-five %   -  thirty-five %   (  mihalits share of future revenue thirty-five  )  leads to the fact that a joint venture would cover our costs and as a matter of fact is worthless to metallurg .  for that reason a further negotiation can only be reasonable if you would agree to lower your offer to that level .  to help you turn in i will agree to divide the payment of workers hired for the jv .  moreover we need a longer duration of the contract as we have to reduce our risk caused by the investments we have to make .  but i will concede and lower our offer to duration of contract eleven as we also provide the bigger asset in this jv we need to have the majority in board .  but i can understand your argument that we need more than one director of mihalitis in board so i raise mihalits directors in board two  ,  which can be seen as the maximum that is feasible to metallurg .  once again a secrecy clause shows us that you don ' t trust metallurg and for that reason a trustful start of a collaboration between the companies for that reason is endangered .  in contrast to your message we won ' t benefit from that secrecy clause in any way as we know that secrecy of important information ,  especially towards competitors ,  is a principle for metallurg .  best wishes ,  mr husar dear mr .  husar ,  we expect the blue star - technology to change the world and will be highly profitable and believe that in the long run ,  this is the most promising innovation in airline engine design in recent history .  because it was our r & d department that succeeded in finding the major keys to develop this technology and we bring in this new technology to the project i think we must be compensated for this .  this collaboration provides you to share in the good reputation of mihalits ag and the succes of our technology ,  from which metallurg technologies will benefit too .  in addition we bring in the knowlegde we already have about this technology in the further development of the combustion chamber ,  i think it is very important to have three members on the board of directors mihalits directors in board three  .  therefor i can’t agree to an offer where metallurg has the larger share of future revenues .  i would like to offer a share of thirty-five %  mihalits share of future revenue sixty-five  .  what i understand from your message ,  and correct me if i am wrong ,  a share of revenues for metallurge technologies under sixty-five %  would not cover your costs ,  and if i won’t meet you in this ,  further negotioatons are useless .  because i don’t want this negotiation to end ,  i am willing to lower my offer if you will meet me in another issue .  i can’t make a big concession in the share of future revenu ,  and also agree on the shared payment of the workers hired for this joint venture payment of workers hired for the jv metallurg  .  but i am prepared to talk about the duration of the contract ,  to lower your risk and have more gain from this collaboration duration of contract five  .  and finally ,  if the secrecy of important information is a principle for metallurg ,  why is signing a secrecy clause a problem secrecy clause yes  ?  although time is running out ,  i hope we can still come to an agreement .  best regards ,  mrs .  koller dear mrs .  koller ,  you are right that metallurg will benefit a lot from an jv .  never the less we also have to be sure that we won ' t pay more than we earn .  for that reason and the fact that time is running out here is my last offer that can be seen as the absolut maximum i can offer you .  to give you an incentive to lower you revenue share to mihalits share of future revenue forty-five  ,  i will agree to the secrecy clause  :  secrecy clause yes  ,  agree to mihalits directors in board three and raise additional compensation ukrainian workers twelve  .  to ensure our revenue at a revenue share of fifty-five %  for us i defenitely need a duration of contract ten  .  i am not authorised to agree that we pay the workers hired for the jv .  for that reason i just can offer you :  payment of workers hired for the jv halfhalf i hope it is possible to agree to my offer as this is the biggest consession i can make .  best regards mr .  husar dear mr .  husar ,  thank you for your generous offer .  unfortunately it is not possible for me to agree on it .  i have been commissioned not to lower the share of future revenue more than a fair split of fifty %,  and that is only when we have three directors on board .  in addition i could offer two directors on board when the share of future revenues is sixty %  for mihalits ag .  both concessions have the same utillity for us ,  so maybe you will benefit more from one or another option ?  furthermore i will lengthen the duration of the contract to eight years ,  but again i am not able to make a bigger concession on this issue .  we are willing to pay half for the workers hired for this jv .  and to compensate for the revenues i could lower my offer on the additional payment of the ukranian workers to ten %.  i hope you will have an advantage from the two options i’ve gave you .  best regards ,  mrs .  koller dear mrs .  koller ,  witha revenue share of fifty %  and a duration of eight years metallurg will pay more than it earns .  as we would benefit from the reputation we receive by this project we generally would agree to that collaboration .  but as this is a risky issue for us we need an absolute trustful collaboration .  for that reason we either need a higher revenue share or are not able to sign the secrecy clause .  best wishes mr .  husar dear mr .  husar ,  i can understand your argument and of course this joint venture should be profitable for metallurg technologies as well .  unfortunately ,  the secrecy clause is unnegotiable for us because we can ' t afford to risk the secrecy of the blue - star technology .  and i hope you can believe me as i say that it is not that we don ' t trust you on this ,  but if we lose control of our technology ,  the whole investment in blue star could be lost and mihalits ag is not in a position to risk this .  furthermore i am not able to lengthen the duration of the contract ,  as much as i would wanted to to come to an mutual agreement in this negotiation .  so my previous offer still counts ,  but i can ' t make any further concessions .  i hope you can understand and we can come to an agreement .  otherwise we probably will have to conclude that this jv can ' t be profitable for the both of us ?  best regards ,  mrs .  koller dear mrs .  koller ,  under these circumstances i accept your offer .  thank you for the negotiations and i hope that our jv will produce a lot of value for both companies .  best wishes mr .  husar dear mr .  husar , first of all ,  i want to thank you for your willingness to negotiate our possible cooperation online .  before we come down to business ,  we would like to introduce ourselves . we ,  the mihalits ag ,  are well - known for our aircraft manufacturer .  mihalits ag was founded in one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-three in a small town in northern austria .  in recent decades we have managed to reach the top of the european aircraft industry .  for our new project we are looking for a reliable partner .  a reliable partner like you .  so far we have only heard good reports about the metallurg technologies .  therefore we want to work with metallurg technologie in the future successful .  we had already clarified some details of a collaboration ,  but some very important details haven´t been clarified .  last time we had not much time to talk about all important points in detail ,  but now we have the opportunity to negotiate all in rest .  as you know ,  the division of future revenues is one of the key issues . we bring a new technology to the project .  we expect this technology will change the world . this is the most promisinginnovation in airline engine design in recent history ,  and it was our r & amp ; d department thatsucceeded in finding the major keys to develop this technology . we are investing more than  seventy-six mio in the joint venture .  metallurg technologies invest in comparison perhaps only half .  for this reason we want to have a split of eighty  -  twenty % we want also a secrecy clause ,  as a part of our contract .  we would like to point out ,  that a new security software would be indicated ,  becouse it would be safty for the whole project .  this clause is of absolute importance for us !  if we lose control of our technology ,  the whole investment for our project could be lost . we feel that we cannot allow metallurg technologies to pay its own workers in the production chain the usual ukrainian wage .  we do not want to be involved in any kind of scandal .  the good reputation of mihalits ag is very important for us .  so we would prefer ,  if all ukrainian workers would be paid an additional wage of twenty %.  well paid employees are less induced to be bribed or to leave the firm .  we would be thankful ,  if metallurg technologies take the payment of the hired employees for the jv . we already agreed with you in our first discussion on a five member board .  the question now is how many of these five members will come from mihalits ag .  we would obviously like to have the majority ,  we would prefer four members .  we expect the management of mihalits ag is more capable to handle such a big joint venture last but not least ,  we must discuss the location of the court of jurisdiction .  the worst choice for uswould be to rely on ukrainian jurisdiction .  there is evidence that foreign companies in theukraine have difficulties demanding their rights .  the austrian body of corporate law is known to be very comprehensive and has already been proven .  corporate law in the ukraine is still very new .  if you want  ,  we can also choose a neutral country ,  like germany . so ,  i &# thirty-nine ; m looking forward to your response  & nbsp ; yours sincerlym . koller dear mr .  koller ,  thank you very much for your first offer .  we really look forward to realize this joint venture together with you as our partner .  i think it is a great chance for both of us .  the main question for us is :  do you want to be part of changing the world  -  or do you want to be left behind ?!  so ,  i think both of us don &# thirty-nine ; t want to be left behind .  so ,  let &# thirty-nine ; s take the chance ! your are right ,  we already agreed on this joint venture basically ,  but now we have to discuss the last issues .  on top ,  i want to be totally honest to you ,  because trust is the most important base on which we have to build up this joint venture .  so ,  here are our opinions : duration of contract :  yes ,  we agreed on a base of five years ,  but that was just to make sure that the joint venture will be realized at all .  for us it is important to secure a long term relationsship and that we will not  ( perhaps )  work for sunk cost .  that &# thirty-nine ; s why we insist on a twelve year contract .  any other solution on this issue cannot be discussed especially because it will take some time till the product will be accepted by the customers etc .   -  so if you want both of us to make profits ... we need this duration . payment ukraine workers :  we understand your point and so we want to help and support you .  but a twenty %  on top payment is a lot of money and we have to compensate it with other sales .  we calculated it and the final result was that ten %  would be fair to our workers .  i think this is already a very good argumentation base for your issue . court :  honestly  -  we don &# thirty-nine ; t see any reason why the court should be in austria or even in germany ,  because the plants and the whole production etc .,  so the  & quot ; company & quot ;  will be located in ukraine .  we never had problems with our courts  -  even more we know them very well and have good connections .   --& gt ;  board :  that is also a reason why we think that it would be a great benefit for the joint venture if we would have the majority .  see ,  the  & quot ; company & quot ;  is located in ukraine ,  the operative decissions will be made in ukraine ,  our workers will earn more money ,  we have an big impact on the region and so it is necessary that  & quot ; we & quot ;  can talk to our goverment and our court .  anything else would make the people here in the ukraine suspicious .  by the way  -  i think none of us is  & quot ; better & quot ;  in handling this joint venture .  it is a challenge for both of us and it will only be successful if we work together and trust in our partner .  so ,  that was not a  & quot ; nice & quot ;  point you mentioned and i feel a bit disappointed .  but ,  i think a four to one combination is also not good ,  because then we always have the situation that one party is disadvantaged .  so ,  a three - two combination is the best solution i think . secrecy clause :  honestly ,  talking about this point is not for any economic issues  -  but about trust and partnership .  you want us to develop and produce it  -  than you have to share your knowledge with us .  if you do not agree on sharing your technology with us it indicates that you do not trust in us as your partner .  that would have a totally negative influence in our partnership .  on top ,  talking about  & quot ; losing the control of your technology & quot ;  also disappoints me .  this technology is the chance for both of us .  nobody can realize it without the other ,  so it must be secured that we have a common base to talk and so we both need the knowledge .  revenue :  this is simple because we can only pay our fix costs with minimum sixty-five %.  so ,  twenty %  is no way ... again sixty-five %  is a minimum for us  -  otherwise there is no money to keep this project alive .  but even then we do not even see any profits ... moreover ,  we have the additional payments for workers ,  plants ,  production ,  security software ... etc .  so ,  perhaps you invest seventy-six mio  ... but that &# thirty-nine ; s less than we have to invest and so we have the higher risk which should be compensated .  that &# thirty-nine ; s why a ten - ninety solution is acceptable for us . payment of hired workers :  again ,  we don &# thirty-nine ; t see any reasons why we should pay for them alone .  we already give you our existing workers to produce it .  for sure you will send some enigneers etc .  but that &# thirty-nine ; s a minimum of what we can expect .  so ,  we support this joint venture with many of our workers for the base and therefore it is just fair if you would pay for the additional ones . best regards , husar dear mr .  husar , thank you very much for your quick response .  the leadership of mihalits ag has come together and discussed plenty about your response .  we want to mention that we respect your opinion on this matter ,  but your proposals are not nearly acceptable for us .  your suggestions hardly correspond to our expectations .  nevertheless ,  we think that we can solve this problem rationally . now we focus on your offer .  your opinion is that the project should have a duration of at least twelve years .  we can not agree with this term .  it is definitely too long .  we understand your cares ,  that you can loose a lot of money through this decision ,  so we are ready to offer you a new deal .  our experts are sure ,  that in five years we should bethrough the worst of the development headaches and be in a better bargaining position .  therefore ,  we are ready to set the term to seven years .  then we can decide ,  if we want to renew our contract with a new durationwe can only emphasize again and again ,  that the good reputation of mihalits ag is very important for us .   .  so we would prefer ,  if all ukrainian workers would be paid an additional wage of twenty %.  we are not ready to reduce this amount .  well paid employees are less induced to be bribed or to leave the firm .  when workers leave the company ,  then the project may be in danger .  if that happens ,  then all the millions and plans were for nothing .  we hope you are the same opinion .  for this reason we insist on the additional wage of twenty %.  we are ready to send some engineers to ukraine and to pay a portion of the wages for the hired workers but we are not ready to pay the total wage for the hired workers .  that would be an absolute imposition !  we are ready to share the payment for the hired workers in a split of fifty - fifty % you demand that you should get ninety %  of the future revenues ?  we wouldn &# thirty-nine ; t dream of doing something like that .  an emphatic no to your offer .  we are not ready such a split .  normally it should be split in eighty - twenty %.  the reason is also very simple why it should be done in such a split .  we had the discovery that can change the world .  this is the most promisinginnovation in airline engine design in recent history ,  and it was our r & amp ; d department thatsucceeded in finding the major keys to develop this technology .  furthermore ,  our portion of overall costs are two - thirds .  we make you an offer ,  we are willing to give you thirty %  of the future revenues .  a higher amount is impossilble . the location of the court of jurisdiction must be in austria or germany .  ukraine is certainly not possible .  there is evidence that foreign companies in theukraine have difficulties demanding their rights .  maybe you had never problems with your courts ,  but many foreign companies had a lot of problems to demanding their rights !  for this reason ,  we don´t want to take any risks .  so there is only one solution ,  either germany or austria . we would like to have the majority on the board of directors ,  so at least three .  we can´t accept your offer .  we would like to mention ,  that we invest more then seventy-six million euros ,  so we want to have the majority .  at this point ,  we want to excuse for our statement ,  that we would be better in handling this joint venture .  as a result that we invest a lot ,  we are also associated with a lot of risk ,  so now we hope that you recognize ,  why we want to have the majority .  so we make you a new deal , we don´t want to have a four to one combination ,  because we understand your worrys and we also don´t want to have the situation that one party is disadvantaged so we would suggest ,  that a three - two combination is the best solution for both sides . we still demand for a secrecy clause .  this clause if of absolute importancefor us !  if we lose control of our technology ,  the whole investment in blue star could be lost . you´re right ,  we want you to develop and produce it  but we are not ready to share all of our knowledge with us .  we want to wait and see how our cooperation runs .  if it should go well ,  then we agree on sharing our technology with you . despite our different ways of thinking ,  we still think that we can have a good cooperation . your sincerelym . koller dear mr .  koller , thank you very much for your answer .  honestly ,  i do not agree with all of your points and parts of your argumentation is not really undecided .  on the other hand i totally understand your points and so we can accomodate you . duration of contract :  as you said we need five years for building up everything ,  then two years for making money ?  it &# thirty-nine ; s not worth do it only for two years .  so okay ,  ten years should be acceptable . add .  compensation :  the main problem is not that employees could think about leaving the company ,  but what will happen after the joint venture ?!  have you ever thought about that ?  then we will have to go on paying them the higher salary ,  so it is not possible for us to do twenty %.  finally ,  let &# thirty-nine ; s meet in the half  @  fourteen %.   ( fifteen is not possible in the system )... court :  germany is okaypayment of hired workers :  half / half is acceptabledirectors :  your argumentation based on your investment is weak  -  i already answered you on that the last time .  still ,  a three - two combination is okay .   ( remember ,  i never thought about a four - one solution ... just to make it fair right from the beginning ) revenue  & amp ;  secrecy :  okay ,  i can accept your secrecy clause and understand your point ,  but for that you have to accept my offer on the revenue .  as i told you we need sixty-five %  to pay our fix costs ,  otherwise the project is not possible from the economic side  =  we wouldn &# thirty-nine ; t even make one cent .  so ,  minimum is sixty-five %.  but even then we wouldn &# thirty-nine ; t have made one cent ...  profit  =  turnover  -  kfix  -  kvar ... so ,  sixty-five %  means kfix is fine ... but what about kvar ?!  you see the problem ?  i can offer you twenty %... on top the agreement on the secrecy clause .  i think that &# thirty-nine ; s more than fair . best regards , husar dear mr . husarthank you very much for your quick response .  the leadership of mihalits ag has come again together and discussed plenty about your response .  we want to thank you for accepting some of our suggestions ,  but there are even some details to discuss .  we are very happy that you have accept the secrecy clause .  furthermore ,  we are also glad ,  that you choose germany for the location of the court of jurisdiction and accept to share the payment for the hired workers in a split of fifty - fifty %.  we would like to thank you very much for your decision . for that reason we think that we can have a good cooperation . let´s clear the last details to sign the contracts .  let´s talk about the duration of the contract .  ten years is a long time .  we don´t want to have a contact with such a duration ..  we want to see how our cooperation will be .  if we should cooperate well together ,  then of course we are willing to extend the duration another three to five years .  we make you an offer ,  we are willing to sign a eight year contract .  as we already told you ,  if we should cooperate well together ,  then of course we are willing to extend the duration another three to five years . we also understand that you have to defray your costs ,  however we don´t understand why you have such great costs .  we thought that the production and wages for labers in ukraine are cheap ,  so could you please explain ,  why your need sixty-five %  of the future revenues ?  we have also to pay wages for our labers ,  pay taxes ect .  and these are greater then in ukraine .  so twenty %  is never ever enough .  to reduce your costs ,  we are ready to decline the additional compensation to ten %.  in addition to it ,  we are willing to give you fifty %  of the future revenues .  therefor we want to have a three - two combination on the board of directors .  aside from the fact that we invest more then seventy-six million in this project ,  it was our discovery .  it was our innovation ,  so we think that we have the right to decide about the combination and we want to have a three - two combination .  this is our last offer .  we still think that we can have a good cooperation .  your sincerelymr . koller dear mr .  koller , thanks for your answer .  yes ,  you are right  -  i already agreed on three  (!)  of your wishes ... and so it is interesting that you still write what you  & quot ; want & quot ;.  honestly ,  we have to figure out what is  & quot ; possible & quot ;  and not what we want . thus ,  i talked to the ceo and all the other directors and we agreed on a cross - subsiditaion ,  but for that we need a proof for the long term partnership with you and the possibility to act fast in daily business .  in figures :  we are willing to go down to seventy %   -  but that for we need a ten year contract  & amp ;  three directors .  finally ,  we did not change anything in the figures to our last message ,  but offer you ten %  more of the revenue .  that &# thirty-nine ; s all we can do for you . by the way  -  yes ,  it is your innovation ,  but an innovation without production plants will not increase the cash in your wallet . on top it would be good if we could sign the contract contemporary and start working ,  because that &# thirty-nine ; s what we really want  -  both of us .  best regards , husar dear mr .  husar , this is to inform you that a cooperation between mihalits ag and metallurg technologies will not be possible .  we deeply regret that our negotiate ends hereby .  unfortunately ,  our offers doesn´t match ,  they´re wide apart .  many factors such as the future revenues or the board of directors are unconvertible .  for this reason we have chosen another company and we are ready to conclude a contract with them .  another negotiating with metallburg technologies seemed senseless ,  so we decided for the other company . we wish you all the very best to to shape your future !  we apologise for any inconvenience . your sincerely . koller dear mr .  mendel ,  hope you are doing well !  as the management of both our companies have agreed on building a fruitful partnership to face the upcoming disruptions in our market best with the innovation of green spirit ,  i would like to introduce myself as sasa novak ,  reaching out to you to tighten the general terms hurm ag and svn tech have established in their first round of discussions so far .  please find attached a proposal for the open issues of our joint venture ,  which i would like to explain to you as following :  one .  directors first ,  we would like to address the unsolved the issue of the number of directors that are sent by hurm ag and svn tech :  since we both agreed on a decision - making committee consisting of five members with a simple majority power ,  we strongly suggest dividing those seats two : three ,  so that we ,  svn tech ,  would be able to deal with the local authorities and partners successfully by using our strong local network and relationships .  two .  engineers to develop a thorough and convenient product ,  sharing experiences from both sides is not only inspiring but essential  & ndash ;  thus ,  we are looking forward to set up the production process with the valuable input of your engineers and to work a few months together to make adaptions and improve our product !  in our experience ,  this may take about twelve months .  three .  common workers in establishing a high joint utility ,  we seek a solution with equally distributed assets  & ndash ;  facing that each of us will continue paying their workers ,  we would very appreciate it if hurm ag could take care of potentially hired common workers in the future .  since these workers would be assigned to the highly valuable and cost - intense production sites and technology provided by svn tech ,  this would be a quite forthcoming solution for us .  four .  slovenian workers as a well - known manufacturer in slovenia ,  we already provide great working conditions with salaries far above the average in easter europe ,  which we are more than happy to continue in our relationship .  five .  court of jurisdiction for legal issues to be resolved ,  we support a solution that minimizes the cost for the both of us :  since our courts are quite familiar with issues regarding joint ventures that place the production sites in our country ,  we see a court of jurisdiction ,  that has great experiences with such issues ,  as a great option for our joint venture .  please feel free to contact me if you have any questions regarding our proposal .  looking forward to hearing from you soon .  kind regards ,  sasa novak dear mr .  novak ,  thank you for reaching out to me ! i apologize for the slight delay in getting back to you ,  my colleagues and i are in the midst of preparing for our upcoming joint venture and we couldn ' t be more excited !  as you already know ,  my name is finn mendel and i will be your correspondence for this period of time of solidifying the agreements between hurm ag and svn tech respectively .  i have read your proposal for the open issues of our joint venture ,  however i have some thoughts on what you have discussed .  below is my explanation :  directors while we have agreed on the five members with a simple majority power ,  we believe having four members from hurm ag will be more suitable for this venture .  this is because our directors are extremely experienced and have completed multiple joint ventures before with other european countries .  however ,  we will need one from svn tech for ,  as you mentioned previously ,  to deal with local authorities and partners successfully .  engineers we fully agree to send our swiss engineers to svn tech ,  as it is in our interest to push the development of thegreen spirit engine .  however ,  because of their prior commitments to our local production and the fact that they will be far from home ,  we propose to work for an additional six months together to improve the product .  common workers we agree with you that each of us will continue paying our workers ,  however we believe workers specially hired for the joint venture should be paid in equal terms by both of our companies .  additionally ,  we would appreciate it very much if the commonly hired workers could be paid by svn tech only .  slovenian workers we have heard of your good reputation of providing great working conditions for your workers ,  and with salaries above the average in eastern europe !  however ,  we at hurm ag believe that the workers should be compensated .  we consider an additional plus should be added to their salaries of twenty %  paid by svn tech .  we at hurm ag believe this will increase their satisfaction and push the development of our joint venture .  court of jurisdiction finally ,  we at hurm ag are very open and direct .  we have no intentions to play any tricks or tactical manoeuvres during the cooperation with you at svn tech .  we propose that we rely on our reputable swiss court ,  as they are also highly experienced with issues regarding joint ventures .  and that is it !  please don ' t hesitate to contact me should you have any questions in regards to our proposal above .  looking forward to your reply .  regards ,  finn mendel dear mr .  mendel ,  thank your kind response  & ndash ;  no need to hurry ,  i guess we both have to face some daily firefighting in our businesses !  let us take the time we need to create the frame in which our joint venture can perform and flourish best .  appreciating your feedback ,  i feel that we are both target the same goals and move in the same direction .  to not get lost in the details ,  i would like to outline some interdependencies as below :  operational issues  ( issue two ,  three ,  four ):  we understand that twelve months would be quite a long time for your engineers and their families  & ndash ;  considering this ,  i already reached out to our production team ,  asking whether it would be possible to shorten this stay .  there is no official statement yet ,  but i feel that we could reduce it to nine months if that would be a suitable solution for you ?  from our experience ,  this phase is very crucial for a long - term success ,  thus ,  a stay of less than nine months would lead to a huge decrease in our product quality and production efficiency .  to implement this approach ,  we would have to shift our resources accordingly so that we could not stem another twenty percent increase of our workers compensation .  but as we always strive to improve our working and we value our collaboration ,  i would try to get a management approval of a ten percent increase .  facing this increase in compensation ,  we would be very appreciative if the hurm ag would be willing to cover the payment of commonly hired workers .  i am aware that this is quite a lot to ask ,  but as svn tech already brings valuable production assets in place ,  this would reflect our consistent partnership with equally distributed resources .  bureaucratic issues  ( issue one ,  five ):  as svn tech values the experience of your directors ,  we could agree to an additional seat to the hurm ag so that three svn tech members would be represented in the board for a fruitful exchange of information and experience within our landsman .  appreciating you as a trusting and valuable partner ,  we seek for a solution that reflects our equally distributed assets in equally distributed power  & ndash ;  thus ,  being represented with only three svn tech members could only be an option for this with a court in slovenia .  thank you for your cooporation so far and have a nice evening .  looking forward to hearing from you .  best regards ,  sasa novak dear mr .  novak ,  thank you for your swift reply !  i have read your second set of proposals below and have discussed it with my colleagues here at hurm ag .  below i have some feedback on what was discussed previously :  operational issues  ( issue two ,  three and four ):  considering that both of our companies want to avoid a huge decrease in product quality and product efficiency ,  we have spoken to the swiss engineers and they have agreed that additional nine months in slovenia is acceptable .  we will ensure that our engineers will work hard due to the shortened time and ensure that thegreen spiritengine will have the optimum quality ,  so that they can return home soon and meet their other commitments as well .  in terms of the additional compensation ,  we understand that twenty %  is considered quite high and therefore we wait for the feedback from your management .  would it be possible to decrease it to fifteen %  for the workers ?  due to the engineers are working an additional nine months ,  we would be very appreciative if you could cover the salaries of the commonly hired workers .  we will need to debrief and explain to our engineers and their families of the increase in work time in slovenia for this joint venture and compensate them according to hurm ag ' s guidelines .  bureaucratic issues  ( issue one ,  five ):  i see that you agree to have three directors from hurm ag on the board ?  if that is the case ,  we agree that three members from hurm ag and two members from svn tech would be the most ideal situation ,  and to ensure that both worlds can share experience and knowledge from both companies respectively .  i have yet to succeed in convincing my colleagues regarding the courts of jurisdiction ,  at this point we are firm on using a swiss court for the joint venture .  i will let you know if anything changes on our end .  thank you as well for your cooperation and understanding so far ,  have a good rest of your day and looking forward to hearing from you ! regards ,  finn mendel dear mr .  mendel ,  thank you for your proposal and your efforts so far !  it seems as we are getting close to resolving the open issues ,  so that i discussed the remaining issues in accordance to your proposal as you can find below :  operational issues  ( issue two ,  four )  at first  -  sorry for the misunderstanding ,  we do not plan to staff your workers on overtime as i believe both our firms want to keep their workers in a good mental and physical health .  speaking of this ,  it would seem to be a more sophisticated solution if the hurm ag would not compensate additional hours for the workers but take care of additional hired workers ?  to make sure that this will not turn out to be a huge burden for you ,  i reassured with the production staff planning that these costs will stay minimal ,  to be specific not as high as the ten %  increase would be for svn tech .  having said this ,  a compensation of more than ten %  leads to a dramatic increase in cost ,  which could lead to a decrease in competitiveness of our final product since we would need to shift our resources accordingly .  bureaucratic issues  ( five )  as it was quite difficult for me to justify the decision of only two svn tech board members to our management ,  they are quite unhappy with being the minority in the board and defining switzerland as court of jurisdiction at the same time  & ndash ;  so unfortunately ,  a court in switzerland does not seem to be an option for them .  anyway ,  since you and i are trying hard to reach a joint solution here ,  i highlighted the contribution for your experienced directors and proposed that we could send a signal as partners and look for a common solution ,  that is hiring independent arbitrators ?  last but not least :  as we both are highly involved in shaping our joint venture ,  i would be more than happy to invite you sometime to slovenia to see the result of our commitment by yourself !  looking forward to your response .  best ,  sasa novak dear mr .  novak ,  visiting slovenia would be lovely !  i look forward to doing so and visit your company after we have finalized the agreements for our joint venture .  that being said ,  i do agree with you that we are getting close to resolving the open issues .  i have read through what you proposed in your previous message ,  and i have included my feedback below :  operational issues  ( two , four )  i propose to do half and half instead of putting the responsibility solely on svn tech to pay the commonly hired workers for the joint venture .  we believe this is a fair outcome ,  and this will ensure that the project can keep going without delays in productivity and no decrease in quality .  that being said ,  we are firm on giving an additional fifteen %  to the slovenian workers for compensation ,  as we believe this will encourage them to work hard for our benefits and also continue maintaining a good working environment and conditions .  we ,  of course ,  would appreciate it very much if this compensation can be covered by svn tech .  bureaucratic issue  ( five )  firstly ,  thank you for agreeing to have three hurm ag members on the board .  while i understand the dissappointment ,  we assure you that despite the lower number ,  we will ensure we will take into account every single factor and elements whilst making major decisions .  that being said ,  my colleagues and i have agreed with you on hiring independent arbitrators ,  instead of using the swiss and slovenian courts for our joint venture .  we wholeheartedly believe that having a third party oversee our collaboration will be an acceptable solution .  we hope the offers above can satisfy svn tech .  please don ' t hesitate to contact me should you have any questions ,  thank you and looking forward to your reply ! regards ,  finn mendel dear mr .  mendel ,  great ,  we are already looking forward to welcoming you in slovenia !  at first ,  thank you for your efforts in achieving this agreement so far  & ndash ;  i am positive that our contract will set a solid foundation for green spirit !  anyway ,  i have asked my collegues to come to a conclusion ,  so that we are pleased to propose this contract for the remaining issues to be resolved  ( issue three and four ).  as we fully understand both your arguments regarding the payment of common workers and additional compensation of slovenian workers ,  we can accomodate you with the following :  we take care of half of the payment of common workers and offer our workers a ten %  increase at the same time or we will come upon a way to increase to fifteen %  but would not be able to reallocate resources for additional workers at the same time ,  so that we would very much appreciate if the hurm ag could take care of the common workers .  please let me know which alternative would be the most suitable for the hurm ag .  looking forward to resolving our last issues and starting with the actual project .  best ,  sasa novak dear mr .  mendel ,  thank you for your message  -  i could not send a direct counteroffer to your last message either ,  thus ,  i reach out to you replying on your last offer .  we are pleased to hear that we have come to an agreement ,  it was a pleasure working with you so far and i am already excited about our upcoming next steps !  please do not hesitate to contact me if anything comes up .  best regards ,  sasa novak dear mr .  novak ,  unfortunately i have a bit of bad news .  i explained to my colleagues that we are close to reaching an agreement ,  but having gone through the overview of our agreed proposals ,  my colleagues at hurm ag asked me if we could reconsider the following issue :  court of jurisdiction instead of hiring independent arbitrators as we agreed ,  they asked if you would reconsider using a swiss court for our joint venture .  we believe that by using a swiss court ,  with their extensive experience with multinational collaborations and prestigious justice system ,  will be most ideal for our joint venture .  this is also considering we are sending our engineers out to slovenia for an additional nine months ,  we want to make sure that they have a peace of mind during their expatriate commitments for our joint venture .  i apologize for the last minute proposal ,  but please let me know as soon as you can .  regards ,  finn mendel dear mr .  mendel ,  i am sorry to hear that your offer has changed on such short notice .  as we appreciate your thoughts on that ,  we can agree on a court of jurisdiction in switzerland ,  given that hurm ag sends two board members to slovenia ,  wich will also reduce your costs .  striving for balanced partnership ,  we need to find a way to balance these two options .  kind regards ,  sasa novak dear mr .  novak ,  unfortunately the number of board directors for hurm ag is our final offer .  we truly believe that having three : two on the board would benefit both of our companies in the long run .  that being said ,  on the agenda on the right is what my colleagues and i have offered .  please let me know if you have any questions or concerns ,  thank you !  regards ,  finn mendel dear mr .  mendel ,  given that we already trusted in your word regarding our final offer ,  our management is afraid that their directors will not be heard in the board .  given that svn tech will have a very vivid exchange with our local authorities and partners ,  these insights of our directors will be essential for a positive long - term development that this voice will be respected and represented .  i hope that you value our commitment and can understand that we are quite surprised of your recent deviations from already made agreements .  kind regards ,  sasa novak dear mr .  novak ,  i would like to apologize for the last - minute deviation ,  but to be frank with you i do not feel satisfied with what we have agreed upon .  i have double - checked again with my colleagues at hurm ag and the agenda on the right are the final numbers we are offering .  we hope you understand our stance in this agreement ,  but we will understand if you do not feel comfortable accepting these terms .  should you have any questions or concerns please do not hesitate to contact me ,  thank you ! regards ,  finn mendel   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     hello h .  husar !  they asked me to send the first message .  i ' m still not very used to the system so hopefully you will receive this !   :   )  i hope we are able to help eachother out with this negotiation case and that we will both be happy with the results .  please let me know if you received this first message so we can start to negotiate .  hope to hear from you soon !   :   )  kind regards ,  kim koller hi kim ,  trust you are doing well !  i have received your message ,  and i ' m really looking foward to work with you on this negotiation about our joint venture .  i ' m sure a long - term cooperation regarding blue star will strenghten both firms and will help to suceed in the future aircraft industry .  i hope we can find a solution that satisfies the interests and goals of both firms .  all the best ,  hennadij hi again hennadij !  first of all ,  sorry that you had to wait that long for my message !  i ' ve been away for the weekend which was fun but did unfortunately not allow me to send you my offer  :   )  but here it is !  mihalits would like to have an extra compensation for ukrainian workers ,  more or less twenty-eight %  extra would do .  additional compensation ukrainian workers twenty-eight mihalitis prefers austria as the country for the court of jurisdiction court of jurisdiction austria  .  as already been spoken of we like to have a contract of five years .  duration of contract five our preferences for the board of directors would of course be a five members of mihalits but there might be spot left for metallurg  ;   )  mihalits directors in board five because of the massive investments of mihalits concerning blue star we really want ninety  %  of the future revenue .  mihalits share of future revenue ninety due to the same investments in the technology of blue star mihalits insists on a secrecy clause to protect the knowledge gained for the sake of both mihalits and metallurg .  secrecy clause yes the last aspect is the payment of the workers hired for the joint venture ,  mihaltis would really appreciate it if metallurg would cover these costs .  payment of workers hired for the jv metallurg i ' m really looking forward to your answer and your counteroffers !  kim dear kim ,  i ' m glad you had a wonderfull weekend ,  mine wasn ' t too bad as well !  this morrning i was in a meeting with olga yarmolenko our head of the negotiation team ,  and we discussed your first offer .  i think the most important aspect is that we should remind us ,  that the development and production of blue star is joint venture which consists of equal partners .  therefore we think it ' s fair to split the benefits ,  as well as the risks ,  equally on both parties .  we know that a clear value cannot be assigned to the technology that you will provide because you havn ' t shown us exactly what the new engine will look like .  furthermore you have to consider that we bear more risks in this joint venture as you do e . g .  we have to build three new plants for the production of the goods .  mihalits share of future revenue twenty as you can see ,  this joint venture is very risky for us ,  and especially the first five years can be very challenging  .  the success is not gusareanteed ,  and as we have to make a lot of investments it bears a high risk for us .  so threrefore we aim for a long - term relationship .  duration of contract twelve  .  when entering this joint venture we commited us as equal partners with mutual respect and trust .  we will guarantee you that there won ' t occour any secrecy lacks .  this means yu can trust us and a secrecy clause no is not necessary .  you also have to bear in mind ,  that we are looking at an “ukrainian company”  ,  as the production of blue star is located in ukraine .  we have to work with the local authorities and local partners ,  thus it is imporant to know these people and speak their  \" language \".  it would be very hard for mihaltis if they had to deal with the local partners and authorities .  what i ' m trying to say is ,  that for both of us it would be more beneficial if the board would predominatly consist of locals mihalits directors in board one because mihaltis as a “foreign firm” could suffer from its alien status .  regarding the court of jouristriction i ' m not quite sure why you suggest to have it a ukrainian joint venture  ,  which plant is located in the ukraine should be subject to austrian law ?  why do you have difficulties with having the court of jurisdiction ukraine  ?  we can talk about the additional compensation ukrainian workers twenty-eight as we have built the plant ,  and also have to pay our own workers i think it would be fair  ( as you come from a high wage country )  to share the payment of workers hired for the jv halfhalf all the best and many greetings from could ukraine  :)  hennadij dear hennadij ,  good to hear that you had a nice weekend as well !  in contrary to your counteroffer  ,  some of the aspects really shocked me .  especially the share in future revenue ,  i ' ve talked toe mihalits about this and they can ' t take a future revenue of twenty %  serious .  although they do understand the concern of metallurg on the investments which have to be made for the plants these investments are very small comparing to the investments already made by mihalits for the blue star .  calculation has been done by the finance department which states that mihaltis blue star brings at least three times as much value to the table than metallurg with its investments which still have to be made .  so we took at least three times as much risk as you will do when our cooperation will end successful .  i can imagine you are a bit worried because you don ' t know what the engine would look like but our engineers have done research which pointed out that there is a chance of eighty-five %  that the blue star will be a success which is a very positive prospective !  because of the high value en the amount of effort everyone of mihalits has put into the blue star we hope you understand we would appreciate a secrecy clause .  of course we trust metallurg but we just want an extra confirmation that no information about the blue star will end up in hands of a third party .  we hope you understand our concern about this .  secrecy clause yes for the sake of the joint venture i believe it is better to give a bit more space to mihalits directors in the board .  mihaltis directors have already a lot of experience with a big joint venture like this and know a lot about the blue star .  and of course because the blue star is like mihalits baby they of course would like to have control in the directors board as well .  but mihaltits agrees with metallurg that we should not represent ourselves as an foreign firm and therefore we need members of both parties .  but isn ' t a joint venture between a foreign western country and an ukrainian company a very positive signal to the rest of the region ?  which is can use a boost and some positive news according to our information ?  mihalits let me suggest two members of metallurg and three of mihalits ,  so we have the experience of mihaltits and the ukrainian members who can represent the joint venture in ukraine .  mihalits directors in board three i have to warn you that on this point mihalits will not show any flexibility any more ,  to leave control to others about the blue star is a huge offer for mihalits .  for the duration of the contract mihalits understands the concerns of metallurg on the investments made .  but in the earlier contact between mihalits and metallurg we agreed on a minimum contract duration of five years .  of course twelve years is concerning a minimum contract duration of five years a possibility but this lies very far from the first proposed duration .  a bit to far according to the desires of mihalits .  they prefer a shorter duration .  they feel that when the parties after five years agree the cooperation is succesfull they can expand the duration  ( which we of course hope for )  but when things are not like expected both parties should have the opportunity to step out .  duration of contract five mihalits appreciates the thought of sharing things in an honest way and therefore is willing to give in on the payment for the workers to split that .  payment of workers hired for the jv halfhalf so mihalits has given in and asks in return some giving in as well .  especially on the future revenue ,  they are simply not responding to your offer .  and the final aspect ,  the court of jurisdiction ,  they ask some giving in on your part as well .  mihalits prefers austria of course because it has some experience there but also because the austrian body of corporate law is known to be very comprehensive and has already been proven .  in contrary to the ukrainian law ,  this corporate law is very new and there is evidence that foreign countries in ukraine had troubles defending their rights .  although we hopefully and most likely will never ever have to go to court we thus prefer the austrian court of jurisdiction .  court of jurisdiction austria i hope you understand the concerns of mihalits and we can continue to develop an agreement which is in the best interests of both parties .  kind regards ,  kim dear kim ,  thanks for the quick response .  i have to say ,  that your offers don ' t really give us the feeling that we are talking about a joint venture .  we should be equal partners and apart from the payment of workers hired for the jv halfhalf i don ' t really see the characteristics of a joint venture .  we also see a lot of distrust  ( e . g .  court of jouristriction in austria ,  secrecy clause no  ,  just five years duration contract ...)  this does not really implement that you will seriously want to make business with us .  we totally agree that the investments for the development of blue star are much higher than the costs for building the plants .  but as a matter of fact ,  the costs which mihaltis has already made are no specific costs and furthermore those costs are sunk costs .  you can not consider these sunk costs on your future decisions .  these costs already occurred and are totally independent from the cooperation partner thus ,  you don ' t bear any risk regarding the cooperation partner .  what i’m trying to say is ,  that the costs for building the three plants ,  the installation of the new security software  ( for which we are bearing the entire financial burden )  and in particular the costs for upgrading the transportation and electricity infrastructure in the region are all specific costs which haven’t occurred yet !  as you have mentioned ,  even your engineers are not quite sure if blue star will be successful .  so you see that we have to bear a very high risk ,  the highest risk we ever took in the history of metalurg .  as you now probably see ,  the specific investments on our side are pretty high .  as a signal ,  that you believe in the success of your product we would appreciate if you could make concessions regarding the future revenues .  we don’t think that ten %  of the future revenues equals the specific investments and risks that we have on our side .  mihalits share of future revenue twenty-five thereby you can probably also understand that we are focussed on a long - term cooperation  (  duration of contract ten  )   .  it was a huge effort to covince the local authorities to get the construction permit for the whole infrastructure construction works .  just picture ,  that we will built streets and electrical infrastructure and after five years mihaltis would end the contract ...  this would be the end for metalurg and the whole region .  i don ' t think we will find a solution if we fight about these issues .  it ' s more important that you understand our point of view .  i ' m sure we will find issues where each one can make concessions .  you wanted us to to pay for the workers ,  so we made the concession that we will split the payment of workers hired for the jv halfhalf  .  of course we would have appreciated it if you would pay them .  not only have made concessions regarding the additional compensation of the ukrainian workers ,  we accepted it as you requested additional compensation ukrainian workers twenty-eight  !  this will cost a lot of money ,  but we did it as a signal that we respect your requests .  we are still wondering about the distrust and scruple about the court of jurisdiction ukraine as well as the skills of the ukrainian board members ?  you have chosen a ukrainian firm as your cooperation partner in this joint venture .  don’t you think that this is a bit inconsistent ?  of course your board members know more about the blue star and thus it is important that we have a mixed board .  but we are your production partner ,  and therefore it is necessary to have an experienced knowledge in producing the goods and not in developing them .  as the plants are located in ukraine it is important to have the decision makers at the spot .  furthermore we have our doubts if austrian managers can deal with cultural differences of the ukrainians and of course if a board of “foreigners” will be accepted by the workers .  it is your call ,  because at the end of day it is the quality of the product that decides about the success ,  but we think there should be at least three members of metalurg in the board mihalits directors in board two all the best ,  hennadij hi hennadij !  let ' s approach this differently .  i have the feeling that we both have the feeling that we gave in more than the other .  maybe we can try to focus more on the best outcome for both of us .   :   )  i got the impression that contract duration for metallurg is an important issue .  therefore i ' m willing to give in on this part as much as i can which is an eight year contract duration of contract eight  ,  unfortunately i am not allowed to go any higher than this ,  but i hope this is ok for you .  i shall also lower the additional compensation of the ukrainian workers to twenty %  additional compensation ukrainian workers twenty because you mentioned this was a sacrifice from your site .  in return of both these aspects i ask you to give in on the secrecy clause .  secrecy clause yes i really hope this is not a very important aspect to you .  i will be open about the other aspects as well .  future revenue and members in the board is equally important to mihalits .  i ' m willing to give in on one of the aspects or on both a little .  they might both be important to you as well or you might have an preference for one of them .  therefore i present three proposals of which you can say which one is the best for you :  a .  mihalits directors in the board :  four mihalits future revenue :  fifty b .  mihalits directors in the board :  three mihalits future revenue :  sixty-five c .  mihalits directors in the board :  two mihalits future revenue :  eighty and for the last aspect ,  the court of jurisdiction it is clear that we prefer our own country but i suggest the middle and neutral option :  germany ,  i guess both parties can live with this option .  court of jurisdiction germany i hope that we hereby made the negotiation more open and we can more or less make a fresh start .  you might have good proposals as well of which we both benefit .  please let me know so we can find the best solution for both of mihalits and metallurg .  all the best and i ' m looking forward to your answer !   :   )  kim good morning kim ,  i ' m glad that you are also looking for a solution which benefits for both of us .  so far we already agreed with the split of payment of workers hired for the jv halfhalf  .  it is also ok if we stick to the additional compensation ukrainian workers twenty-eight you don ' t have to make any concessions about that .  it is true ,  that that the duration of the contract is very important for metalurg ,  and we appreciated your concession in this issue ,  but still eight years are too low to cover the risks that we will bear during this joint venture duration of contract ten  .  i like your idea abot the three alternatives ,  but we can ' t accept any of those proposals .  you have to see that this joint venture is just reasonable for us if we get at least the half of the future revenue and if both firms are equally represented in the board of members .  these are our hard constraints and can ' t be lowered .  i think the biggest problem is ,  that mihaltis wants the same .  if this is not the case ,  and mihaltis also accepts lower revenues and boardmembers we can talk about a secrecy clause  (  secrecy clause no  )  and also find a solution regarding the court of jurisdiction  ( which would still prefere to be in ukraine  )  as the board members and the share of the future revenues is important for both sides ,  it could be better not to splitt both fifty - fifty but instead give one party the full power of the board and the other party almost the whole future revenues .  what do you think about that ?  this would help to create more mutul trust ,  and both parties would be better off .  best regards ,  hennadij morning hennadij !  guess we really have the same intersts !  annoying  :   )  i would love to divide the board members and the futre revenue but ...  my hard constraint on the revenues is fifty %   ....  and for the board member its two members so that ' s a bit complicated .  would be nice if metallurg and mihalits decided on six board members before ,  that would be way easier to split !   :   )  oh and i ' m really sorry about the contract duration but i cant get any higher on that than eight years either .  i understand that the compensation of the ukrainian workers is not important to you ,  well for me it isn ' t either so maybe it gives you around five %  extra when i lower to sixteen %?  additional compensation ukrainian workers sixteen  ( when its not ,  well than i will raise it again  ;   )).  i can do that and give in on board members mihalits directors in board two  ,  future revenue mihalits share of future revenue fifty and on the contract duration towards my hard constraint but in return i ask you to give in on the secrecy clause secrecy clause yes and agree on austria court of jurisdiction austria for the court of jurisdiction .  let me know !  kim hi kim ,  sorry for the delayed answer ,  but i was in a business trip on friday and had no internet access .  it ' s a quite complicated situation at the moment ,  as we both thought we could gain more out of the cooperation .  the number of the mihalits directors in board two and mihalits share of future revenue fifty can be accepted by us ,  but i have to admit ,  that this is really far away from what we have expected .  i will give in regarding the secrecy clause yes  .  this will enlarge the security on your side ,  but still ,  we feel that our secrurity is underrepresented in the recent contract .  therefore i need you to expand the duration of contract ten and find a compromise regarding the legal issue of the court of jurisdiction germany additional compensation ukrainian workers sixteen as well as the payment of workers hired for the jv halfhalf is accepted .  all the best ,  hennadij hi hennadij !  we are coming close i guess / hope !  i ' m willing to give in on the court of jurisdiction and make it germany court of jurisdiction germany but i really cant go for the ten year - contract because my hard constraint is eight years .  duration of contract eight i am sorry about that ,  i agree with you that we probably both thought we could both gain more and add some value .  when you agree on the eight year contract we will have a deal .  additional compensation ukrainian workers sixteen mihalits directors in board two mihalits share of future revenue fifty payment of workers hired for the jv halfhalf secrecy clause yes hope to hear from you soon !  kim dear kim ,  i ' m sorry but i ' m not able to revise my last offer .  additional compensation ukrainian workers sixteen court of jurisdiction germany duration of contract ten mihalits directors in board two mihalits share of future revenue fifty payment of workers hired for the jv halfhalf secrecy clause yes it is your call ,  and i hope you will make a wise decision .  best regards ,  hennadij hi hennadij !  we have a disagreement about the contract duration .  i can ' t go any higher than eight years ,  it ' s my hard constraint .  i thought i made this clear before ,  but you could of course have missed that .  i can ' t believe they gave us a case where your hard constraint on this topic is ten years and mine is eight so we will never be able to come to a deal .  so we have to try to find another way to settle things and reconsider everything or we have to conclude the joint venture is impossible or you have to agree on the eight year contract .  i am sorry but i just don ' t have any bargaining range left on this point .  so we settle this or decide to put al our soft constraints ,  hard constraints and importancy factors on the table so we can see how to solve this puzzle .  if you ask me it is just a lot of giving in for both parties and the current agenda is the best we will achieve for both .  kind regards ,  kim ps court of jurisdiction germany duration of contract eight mihalits directors in board two mihalits share of future revenue fifty payment of workers hired for the jv halfhalf secrecy clause yes additional compensation ukrainian workers ten  ( lowering to ten %  is the last gesture i could make to you ,  than i ' m at my hard constraint on this aspect as well ,  i don ' t think it will help things because i got the feeling you didn ' t really cared about this item ,  but its worth the try anyway )  hi kim ,  i agree with you ,  it ' s a lot of giving for both parties .  we are also both very close to our hard constraints .  i didn ' t miss the fact that you can ' t expand the duration .  it was just a test ,  if this is really your hard constraint and it is really impossible for to make any concessions .  i think we both thought that we could gain more utility than we have now ,  and thus both parties are a bit dissappointed .  when i look at the offer ,  i see that my negotiated values a pretty far away from my aspiration level .  suprisingly ,  this is also the case on your end .  i think we both discovered ,  that our positions in this joint venture are pretty far away .  too far away .  blue star would have been a great chance for us ,  but the risk and effort that we exceed the benefits and make this joint venture not attractive enough for us .  i have the feeling / almost know ,  that mehaltis is also not satisfied with the outcome of the negotiation .  this is not a good basis for establishing a joint venture and would have influence our future relationship .  i ' m sorry to tell you ,  but metalurg will reject your offer .  i think we both should look after other cooperating partners which are more suitable for our individual company strategies .  on behalf of the hole metalurg - team ,  i want to thank you for time and effort and we wish mehaltis all the best for their future .  best regards ,  hennadij dear mr ./ ms .  husar , i would like to send you my first offer for our future joint venture .  allthough i &# thirty-nine ; mexpecting some minor difficulties in our negotiation ,  i expect the outcome to be profitable for both of us .  as my company ,  the mihalits ag ,  is going to provide youthe possibility of being part of the greatest innovation in aircraft technology in the near future , and thus having the chance of dramatically improving the finacial situation of metallurg technologies , you have to understand ,  that we also expect a lot from you .  please read my offer carefully and let me know about the issues you want to discuss with me .& nbsp ; kind regardsmr .  koller dear mr .  kolleri received your first offer ,  but there are serveral points which are unfortunatly not acceptable for my company . the additional compensation for the ukrainian workers is too high ,  but we can offer you ten %  for the additional compensation .  my company also thinks that the court of jurisdiction should be in the ukrain ,  because we have a lot to build and invest for our joint venture . the duration of contract should be twelve years because we are looking for a longterm relationship with the mihalits ag and in the early years we have a lot to invest and it will need time for the acceptable revenue . i think the metallurg technologies company should have four directors in board because a large part of the production will be in the ukraine . the share of future revenue should be eighty to twenty because as we said before we have a lot of investition in infrastrucre ,  we have to build three new plants and so on . there should also be no secrecy clause because we want a longterm relationship and it is would kind of trust if we do not use a secrecy clause . kind regardsmr .  husar hello mr .  husar , thanks for your detailed counteroffer .  as i expected ,  we still have a lot of negotiation work to do . an eighty  /  twenty share of the future revenue in favor of metallurg is of course inacceptable for us , since we had high r & amp ; d expenses in the last few years ,  which we have to compensate . therefor ,  i can offer you a seventy-five  / twenty-five share in favor if the mihalits ag .  also ,  i dont think that four members of metallurg in the board of directors are appropriate ,  since my company is the one ,  which brings the most important part ,  the blue star ,  for our jv .  i suggest ,  that we do it the other way around :  four members of the mihalits ag . concernig the court of jurisdiction ,  i think that austria offers both of us a much better legal platform . i &# thirty-nine ; m afraid that the ukranian court could secretly be in favor of ukranian companies . another point of the agenda ,  which really matters to me ,  is the secrecy clause for the combustion chamber .  i dont &# thirty-nine ; t think that you &# thirty-nine ; ll have any disadvantages from it .  in fact ,  i think that we can both only benefit from it ,  since both of our companies could be sure ,  that we will definitely be the first ones to introduce the new technology to the market . i know ,  that i ask a lot from you ,  but i &# thirty-nine ; m also ready to make concessions .  i &# thirty-nine ; m willing to lower the additional compensation for the workers to twenty  %,  since you &# thirty-nine ; ve also beenthrough rough times .  additionally ,  i could accept a contract duration of eight years ,  because we know as well as you to find a depensable partner these days . i &# thirty-nine ; m looking forward for your counteroffer .  if you have any additional questions ,  please let me know . yours sincerelymr .  koller hello mr .  kollerhere is my new counteroffer for you . i know that the r & amp ; d was expensive ,  but we have also huge costs to invest for the infrastructure and the new plants so we can offer a seventy / thirty share for metallurg technologies . i can improve the point with members in the board ,  so i think there sould be three from metallurg technologies because the whole production is in the ukraine . i can offer you germany as a neutral country for the court of jurisdiction . we can make a secrecy clause ,  but then i want that the court of jurisdiction is in the ukrain . kind regardsmr .  koller dear mr .  husar , i think we both made clear ,  that both of our companies are in some kind of financial trouble . unfortunately ,  i can &# thirty-nine ; t offer you a longer duration of the contract than eight years ,  since our companies don &# thirty-nine ; t know each other so well and we want to keep a certain flexibility .  i hope ,  you can understand my argument ,  keeping in mind ,  that todays economy changes rapidly . now here is my proposal : we still want four members in the board of directors ,  but i can offer you to share the payment of the workers hired for the jv and i i can almost agree with your proposals for the additional compensation of the ukranien workers  .  i &# thirty-nine ; m also willing to lower mihalits share of the future revenue to seventy %,  but i want the secrecy clause in return .  thirty %  shouldn &# thirty-nine ; t be too bad for you ,  since you can &# thirty-nine ; t expect any government subsidies . furthermore ,  i completely agree with you ,  that the court of jurisdiction should be in germany .  i don &# thirty-nine ; t think that your company should have any disadvantages with germany ,  since this country has a history ,  that connect western and eastern europe . kind regardsmr .  koller dear mr .  kolleri can offer you a contract duration of ten years ,  because we have huge investments . as before we think that we should have three members in the board of directors ,  because the production is in the ukraine . we can not agree with the future revenue but we can offer you forty %. kind regardsmr .  husar hello mr .  husar , unfortunately i just cant offer you a longer duration of the contract than eight years .  this is the best i can give you concerning this point .  same for the payment of the workers ,  half - half is my last offer for this issue ,  because i don &# thirty-nine ; t see any reason ,  why one of us should pay the workers alone ;  this is a joint venture ,  isn &# thirty-nine ; t it ? but i see ,  that we both agree that germany would be the optimal country for our court of jurisdiction , keeping in mind ,  that we will only need it in an emergency case anyways ... in my oppinion ,  the mihalits ag should still have the majority in the board of directors ,  since we invented the new combustion chamber technology ,  that makes our joint venture possible at last .  also ,  since the production is allready in your country ,  we need a certain security and control over thw whole project ,  to keep the balance of power of our companies . in return ,  i can offer you to decrease the additional compensation for thw workers to twelve %  and to cut down our share of the future revenue to fifty-five %. one more thing :  we dont have much time left ,  please answer me quickly ! kind regardsmr .  koller hello mr .  koller ! here is my new offer ! ok it &# thirty-nine ; s fair if we share the payment of the workers  & quot ; half half & quot ;. we agreed both that the point of the court of jurisdiction should be in germany . we can make a secrecy clause ,  but then we want three directors in the board . for the point of the duration of the contract we can make eight years ,  but then we want sixty %  of the future revenue . kind regardsmr .  husar hello mr .  husar , thank you for your fast response .  i &# thirty-nine ; m happy that we allready agree in several points . but you still didn &# thirty-nine ; t give me an argument ,  why the secrecy clause should have any disadvantges for you  ( unless you are planning to sell our technology to third party companies ,  which i don &# thirty-nine ; t hope ....); therefor ,  i dont &# thirty-nine ; t see why we should give you something in return for it  ( do you ??) furthermore ,  i dont &# thirty-nine ; t think that you should should need a sixty %  share of the future revenue ,  since the ukrainian government allready paid for the whole infrastructure you need to run you factoriesand we didn &# thirty-nine ; t get any subsidies from the austrian state .  plus ,  a duration of eight years for the contract doesn &# thirty-nine ; t justify lowering our share down to forty %.  as you know ,  it &# thirty-nine ; s difficult to find a new partner in this industry nowadays anyways ,  so you have no reason to be scared that we will end the joint venture any time soon . i could make a huge sacrifice by giving you three seats in the board of directors ,  but to lower my companies risk by having the minority ,  i definitely want sixty %  of the future revenue in return ! this a good offer you ,  mr .  husar ,  you &# thirty-nine ; ll have the majority of the members in board of directors ,  allthough you dind &# thirty-nine ; t even give a concrete argument for it ,  you only have to pay half of the workers salaries and you have an extreme low additional compensation for the ukranian workes of only twelve %, that is allready close to provocing a possible scandal . this is as good as it gets for you ,  mr .  husar . kind regardsmr .  koller hello mr .  koller ! in our view ,  the secrecy clause is not a question of economic terms but of treating each other with the appropriate respect that is needed to work together .  the last point to be clarified are the future revenue ,  and i &# thirty-nine ; ll cut mine to fifty %.  however ,  i need at least fifty %  to cover my costs .  kind regardsmr .  husar hello mr .  husar , it seems to me ,  that you don &# thirty-nine ; t have any arguments to support your counteroffer . therefor ,  i see no reason to change my offer .  i &# thirty-nine ; ve allready made a lot of sacrifices for this joint venture ,  now its your turn to make some ,  too . please see this as my last offer based on the arguments of my previous offer . kind regardsmr .  koller hello mr .  koller !  sorry there was sth wrong with the empty message ! in our view ,  the secrecy clause is not a question of economic terms but of treating each other with the appropriate respect that is needed to work togehter & nbsp ;  the last point to be clarified are the future revenue ,  and i &# thirty-nine ; ll cut mine to fifty %.  however ,  i need at least fifty %  to cover my costs .  kind regards mr .  husar hello mr .  husar , thank you for the clarification . you are right ,  that the secrecy clause is a matter of respect ,  too .  but if any information aboutthe blue star combustion chamber is given to a third - party company ,  metallurg would loose as much money as mihalits ,  and we both know that we can &# thirty-nine ; t afford that . i &# thirty-nine ; m willing to accept a fifty / fifty share of the future revenue and only two members of my company in the board of directors ,  but in return i want the court of jurisiction to be in austria .  since i &# thirty-nine ; ve allread given you the majority in the board of directors ,  i need something some security in return  ( please keep in mind ,  that te court of jurisdiction is for emergency cases only ,  anyways ). as we keep loosing money while we negotiate ,  this is my last offer .  please decide ,  if you want to accept this one or one of the last few ones ,  depending on your preferences . kind regardsmr .  koller hello mr .  koller !  as you said the court of jurisdiction is for emergency cases only ,  so it sould be in germany .  you gave me the majority in the board of directors and you got your eight years for the duration of the contract and the secrecy clause .  i have improved the compensation for the ukrainian workers .  this is my last offer and now its your turn .  i think its fair for you and me !  kind regards mr .  husar hello mr .  husar , unfortunately ,  the additional compensation for the workers wouldnt compensatehaving only two members of my company in the board and only getting a fifty %  share at all .... these are major issues that can &# thirty-nine ; t be balanced out by the duration of the contract orsmaller financial issues like the payment of the workers ...  a joint venture under these conditions would definitely not be profitable for the mihalits ag . therefor ,  i have to reject your offer . regards , mr .  koller dear mr .  mendel ,  i would like to send you my first offer .  it is important for me to have an additional compensation of our employees .  this will prevent any kind of scandal .  i want you to know that reputation won ' t be ruined .  our working conditions are free of scandals .  our salaries are far above the average in eastern europe .  it is also important that the project will be conducted under slovenian law because our joint venture will take place in slovenia .  the implementation of a team of arbitrators would lead only to additional costs for both partners .  it is essential for the success that you contribute your know - howfor the project .  therefore we expect that you keep your engineers in our common plants in slovenia for another nine months .  this is absolutely justifiable by the fact that normally several problems arise after the main development of a technlogy has already been finished .  since the engineers are employeed by you ,  we expect you to pay their salaries .  by definition both partners of a joint venture have to bring in assets .  we already take the majority of the burden of the human resources invested in this project .  hence it is a logical consequence that also you should put some emphasis on this topic .  since the project takes place in slovenia ,  we have to provide three employees on the directors board .  this is the only way to ensure a smooth process because it is much easier for a us to work with local authorities and local partners than for a foreign firm who may suffer from its alien status .  i am looking forward to hearing from you soon .  yours sincerely ,  mr .  novak dear mr .  novak ,  i am very grateful for your offer ,  but there some things that i would like to discuss .  first the directors board ,  your offer of providing three slovenian employees in the board is based on the relations within the european market and not on building the product itself .  the relations withlocal authorities and local partners can also be sustained  /  maintained via one representative .  therefore ,  we have to provide four representatives of hurm ag and one representative form svn tech .  second the engineers .  without any doubt we have to send some key engineers as it is also in our interest to push the development of the green spirit engine .  to be honest ,  usually in this kind of business ,  firms providing technology agree to keep their engineers working for additional six months in foreign plants to get the whole thing started and train the local staff .  after these six months your people will be able to solve all of the problems themselves !  we will pay the wages of our own staff ,  and we insist that svn tech will pay for all the slovenian workers .  workers and staff specially hired for the joint venture could be paid for in equal terms by us and by you .  i am a bit disappointed in the fact that you want the project completely under the slovanian law .  it feels like there is a lack of trust so to make clear we do not intend to play tricks or tactical manoeuvres during our cooperation .  but we need some sort of legal security ,  especially because there is evidence that foreign companies face really big problems to demand slovenian rights .  to prevent this it is important that the project will be conducted under our law .  the technological know - how is our key for essential first mover advantage in the future market of the engine industry .  we can by no means afford to lose this knowledge to a competitor .  as the workers in the production chain are the most important we suggest a additional compensation of twenty %.  i am looking forward to hearing from you soon .  yours sincerely ,  mr .  mendel dear mr .  mendel ,  i am very grateful for your fast response .  nevertheless ,  there are still a few points to discuss .  first ,  i understand that you want to have four represantatives in the directors board .  however we would be underrepresented as we are both equal partners in the joint venture .  but you can send three representatives of your company so your directors are in the majority .  let ' s come to the engineers .  normally you are right ,  six months are enough .  but not in our case because we have no know - how in producing the new green spirit engine .  this is because it is a completely innovative new technology .  therefore we need the support of your engineers for nine months .  we prefer that you will pay the common workers because we are still taking the majority of the human resource costs but we understand your point of view .  we will accept your suggestion for paying the common workers in equal terms if you accept our request to have the court of jurisdiction in slovenia .  it is unacceptable for us that you want to have an additional compensation of twenty %.  we are willing to have an additional compensation of ten %  only .  as i said before we are taking the majority of human resource costs .  any other compensation would be beyond our budget .  this point is not negotiable for us .  also we demand to have the court of jurisdiction in slovenia because our project will take place in slovenia .  we do not want to play any kind of tricks or tactical manoeuvres ,  too .  you said that you want to have some sort of legal security .  our slovenian law brings exactly this security .  we are disappointed you don not trust our law .  it feels like you mistrust us as a slovenian company .  we hope that you will reconsider your position because trust is neccessary for the project ' s success .  yours sincerely ,  hello mr .  novak ,  i think we are close but still ,  there are some thing that i am not verry happy about .  first the things that we have agreed on . you agree for paying the common workers in equal terms if i agree for the court jusrisdiction in slovenia .  to find common ground i am willing to hire independent arbitrators to do this for us as this might solve our problem .  but to do this i need you to agree to the additional compensation twenty %  there is no need to negotiate this any further .  if you agree to these terms we have completed three out of five issues .  that rest us with the directors board and the engineers .  did you realy think your offer through ,  first you understand my offer of four directors in the board then ,  you come up with an argument of  \" we would be underrepresented \"  but if you allow three members of our board your are still underrepresented .  therefore i stick with the offer of four respresentatives .  that will bring us to our final point .  engineers .  i am not letting go of the additional six months based on the cost that we have in the payment of the common workers .  the only way for us to accept you offer of three directors and an additional nine engineers is to change the cour of jusisdiction towads switserland .  kind regards ,  dear mr .  mendel ,  there are still many points to discuss and it looks like we can ' t reach an agreement .  so i think we need to change the way we negotiate .  instead of sending a complete offer ,  i am going to tell you the most important point for us ,  where we are not able to accept any other options .  in your reply ,  you may send me the most important point for you .  as a result ,  if your point and mine are different ,  we will have an agreement on two of the five points .  the point of the  \" additional compensation of slovenian workers \"  is the most important one for me as i am not able to change the ten %.  as i said before a higher compensation would be beyond our budget and therefore impossible .  i promise you that your reputation won ' t be ruined .  an additional compensation of ten %  will be sufficient .  you have to know that our employees actually appreciate very good working conditions since our salaries are far above the average in eastern europe .  since this is not what you want ,  we are prepared to compromise on another point .  so i suggest you tell me which point is the most important one for you .  i hope to negotiate in this way ,  we will end up with a compromise .  yours sincerely ,  mr .  novak hello mr .  novak ,  as you might already noticed my most important point is the additional compensation of twenty %  too .  as this is both our most important issues in this negotiation and i already found common ground with you by lowering my initial standards in the issues of common worker payment and court of jurisdiction ,  i can therefore not go any lower than twenty %.  it is therefore better to look towards our second point of interest ,  for us it is this the court of jurisdiction .  as you can see i already lowered my outcome for this issue ,  a reason for us to not accept an offer of ten %  for additional compensation .  i will await your offer .  yours sincerely ,  dear mr .  mendel ,  as i said before our budget is very limited .  if you want us to pay our workers an additional compensation of twenty %,  then you will have to pay the cost for the common workers as we are not able to pay for both .  also you have to accept that your engineers will stay in slovenia for additional nine months .  moreover ,  we will agree with you that you can send four represantatives to the directors board if the place of jurisdinction is agreed to be slovenia .  this would be the fairest solution as in return you get the majority on the directors board and therefore you could make the final decisions regarding the project .  on the other hand ,  this gives us the necessary security to hand over the project management to you .  please note that this offer can not be further improved by us .  we are already renouncing our most important point .  this is very generous ,  as the point at issue is ,  the payment of our employees and that is ,  of course ,  usually our decision .  please consider this offer as a accommodation on our part and as a willingness to come to an agreement .  yours sincerely ,  mr .  novak dear mr .  novak ,  i am sorry to hear that you are not willing to cooperate on several points and i am sad to see that issues wherein we first found common ground are now used as leverage .  this is not a way to show willingness to come to an agreement .  if we want to reach an agreement it has to come from both ways ,  therefore you have to give in on something .  i am willing to accept the aditional nine months that the engineers stay in slovenia ,  and also accept that the payment of common workers is done by hurm ag  ( two points were i give in )  if you accept that we employ five directors in the board .  i will present the offer with my ceo today ,  that means that you either accept the offer or that i will find a decent counteroffer in my mailbox before the end of the day .  kind regards ,  mr .  mendel dear mr .  mendel ,  i will acccept your offer with a single amendment .  instead of five represantatives we agree that you will send four .  we would like to send at least one representative to the directors board as we believe that both companies should be represented here .  thus you have a clear four : one majority and consequently the project management .  since you want to leave the engineers here for nine months and you are willing to pay the common workers ,  we will accept the additional compensation of twenty %,  the fact of the independent arbitrators and your majority in the directos board .  i think we will come to an agreement and thank you in advance for your willingness to reach an agreement and your professional appearance in the negotiations .  yours sincerely ,  mr .  novak hello mr . novak ,  the offer i did before was my final offer .  if you change the amount of directors on board i need some compensation for the the lose i make . this is my final offer .  kind regards ,  mr .  mendel dear mr .  mendel ,  the offer i made was my last offer too .  this was the fairerst as we made a compromise in the last point and each of us got two points .  as the additional compensation is the most important point for both of us it is fair that we get at least one representative for the directors board .  the only alternative  ( as you can see in this offer )  is that the project will be conducted under slovenian law and in return you can send five representatives .  yours sincerely ,  mr .  novak   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       dear mr ./ mrs .  husar , thank you very much for your willingness to negotiate our possible cooperation online .  here is my first offer .  i hope we will come to a conclusion ,  which is lucrative for both of our companies ,  soon . yours sincerly ,  mr .  koller dear mr .  koller , i appreciate your interest of a possible joint venture of our companies ,  but jour previous offer made me a little bit suspicious and i got a feeling being exploited .  if we wanna cooperate and we think about a longterm cooperation ,  there should not be any base for suspicion or mistrust . yours sincerly ,  mr .  husar dear mr .  husar , as i can see the ideas of our future cooperation vary widely .  mihalits ag really want this joint venture with your company ,  but not at any price . first of all i think there has to be a secrecy clause .  as you know the blue star combustion chamber promises high profits ,  not only for mihalits ag but also for metallurg technologies .  if we lose control of our technology ,  we will lose a lot of money and our joint venture is in danger .  this clause has nothing to do with distrust .  it just secures that no third party is getting acces of this technology . the next issue concerns the number of members mihalits ag will have on the board of directors .  we think that mihalits ag should have the majority ,  so at least three directors .  we expect the management of mihalits ag to be more capable to handle such a big joint venture . my last point is the division of future revenues .  i think your last ten  %  offer was not serious at all .  mihalits ag brings a new technology to this project ,  a technology which metallurg technologies would not be able to develop on their own any time soon .  so it should be obvious that mihalits ag deserve a bigger part of future revenues .  because the combustion chamber isn´t finished yet ,  i adapted my offer to seventy  %. with best regards , mr .  koller dear mr .  koller , thirty %  of the revenues would not cover even half of our fixed costs .  three new plants ,  infrastructure and security upgrades ,  r & amp ; d and much more investments we have to make ,  and we are not interested on a loss - making business . due to the fact ,  that most of the work will be done in ukraine and that is much easier for a ukrainian company to work with the local authorities and local partners ,  which will have considerable influence over our joint cooperation ,  we think that we are in a more capable position to handle this joint venture and so it would be better for both of us ,  that we have the majority . a long - term cooperation is very important to us ,  so we want a contract of at least twelve years . as mihalits ag wants to set up a joint venture in ukraine with a ukrainian company ,  it seems obvious that the venture will be subject to ukrainian law .  i cant see why we ,  as a ukrainian firm operating in ukraine ,  would go to court in austria ? regarding the payment of workers we are willing to pay our existing workers ,  and we expect mihalits ag to pay the wages for their existing workers .  as we are already bearing the majority of the burden of the human resource costs involved in this project ,  we would do not want to pay any of the wages of the workers hired specifically for the joint venture . metallurg technologies is usually not prepared to discuss any of its internal matters with any external party .  nevertheless we would be willing to pay twelve %  additional compensation . because of the secrecy clause ,  it seems to us that you do not want to share the whole technology with us ,  which implies that you do not trust and disrespect us as an equal partner in this cooperation . brmr .  husar dear mr .  husar , as i said in my last message the secrecy clause is absolutely prerequisite for our cooperation .  mihalits ag is not interested in losing their technologie to any third company .  i don´t know why you think we would not trust you and disrespect you as an equal partner .  if we would not trust and respect you we would not even negotiate now .  so again ,  the secrecy clause just ensures that the technologie stays where it belongs to ,  namely in our two companies .  this secures us the competitive advantage and in effect brings us the money .  so this clause is in favor of our both not only for mihalits ag .  i hope you now understand what the secrecy clause is about . as i can see the duration of contract seems to be really important for you .  i will make you a very cooperative offer to show our willingness to work together with you .  i would be willing to offer you a long term contract over ten years but only if you give me the majority of the directors in board and sixty  %  of future revenue . a duration of ten years gives your company safety for the future .  in this case ,  we think forty %  of future revenues for metallurg technologies would be enough to cover your fixed costs first ,  and after a few years your company really profits from our joint venture .  i think we should have the majority of directors in board because mihalits ag is a global player and the directors are really experienced .  you would have two directors in board which we think is enough to work with local authorities and local press .  let´s come to the court of jurisdiction .  we do not intend to play any tricks or tactical manoeuvres during the cooperation with metallurg technologies ,  but in any case ,  we need some sort of legal option .  there is evidence that foreign companies in the ukraine have difficulties demanding their rights .  moreover ,  we do not have any experience with ukrainian courts .  most of our lawyers have not practiced there .  the austrian body of corporate law is known to be very comprehensive and has already been proven .  corporate law in the ukraine is still very new .  maybe we should discuss a more neutral country ,  like germany .  i think that woud be the fairest solution for all parties . last but not least ,  let´s talk about the additional compensation of ukrain workers and the payment of workers hired fort he joint venture .  the level of wages of all ukrainian workers involved in the joint venture is also important for us .  the good reputation of mihalits ag is very important for us and we cannot afford to have this reputation ruined .  we do not want to be involved in any kind of scandal !  so we would accept your last twelve  %  offer but only if your company would pay the workers hired for the joint venture .  surely ,  we would pay our staff send to ukrain . yours sincerely , mr . koller dear mr .  koller ,  we are willing to say  & quot ; yes & quot ;  to the secrecy clause ,  if the court of jurisdiction is in ukraine .  we accept a majority of mihalist directors ,  if we get sixty %  of the future revenues . as we are already bearing the majority of the burden of the human resource costs involved in this project ,  we would prefer not to pay any of the wages of the workers hired specifically for the joint venture ,  but a sign of good will and how seriousity ,  we can take the half ot these costs .  brhusar dear mr . husar , first of all ,  i have spoken with the management again .  i am not allowed to offer you more than eight years of contract duration .  so eight years are the absolute maximum i can offer you . as i said in my last messages the secrecy clause has to be there ,  because we are not interested in losing the technologie and we do not want to sell the technology ,  we both want to profit from it . so i think because of accepting the secrecy clause ,  you are not justified to demand for sixty %  of future revenues and to set the court of jurisdiction to ukrain . the fairest solution is to put the court of juridiction to an neutral place .  so germany would be a good solution for both of us . i lowered  ` mihalits share of future revenue´ to fifty-five %  because we really would like to cooperate with yo .  but we also think that we are bringing the thechnology ,  which later earns the profit ,  to this joint venture .  so we deserve the bigger part of future revenues . i hope you are satisfied with my offer . yours sincerely , mr . koller dear mr .  koller ,  this is my final - offer and i hope it leads to a joint venture .  krmr .  husar dear mr .  husar , i am not allowed to accept your final offer .  but i will make you one last offer .  you have to accept or reject this until tomorrow twelve pm . this is the absolute maximum i can offer you .  we are ready to offer you fifty  %  of the revenue but only if we can be sure that this five  %  more we will offer you are invested in the right things .  because of that we want twenty %  of additional compansation for ukrain workers .  only satisfied workers can build high quality products and will stay at your company .  so please think about this last offer .  think about all the advatnteges you will have .  for exampel the reputation you will

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            dear mr .  mendel ,  i hope you are doing well ,  you will find attached here our opening offer ,  i am sure you will appreciate some compromise we came up .  concerning the content of the offer ,  as we have been discussing ,  the engine is still in an early stage of development ,  if there is needs for adjustments without the assistance of your engineers it is going to be problematic .  therefore we are asking for them to stay for nine months . then ,  we agreed to a raise of ten %  of additional compensation of slovenian workers ,  although considering the region standards they are already very well paid .  while on the other hand ,  about the commonly hired workers we insist the hurm takes this burden and pays their wages .  svn tech is already providing the majority of human capital and the plants in this jv ,  we do not intend to go further unless you present a very good reason .  for the two residual issues we are to discuss ,  we believe that being the activities of the jv consistently on slovenian ground ,  first it would be better that svn take care of the relationships with local authorities ,  and therefore hurm should have two members on the board .  second ,  if anything had to happen  -  and we really hope it wont be the case  -  the court of jurisdiction should be here in slovenia .  i must say to you ,  i have talked with the management of svn on the issues i just presented above ,  and they made me understood that two things are most likely not going to change :  the hurms directors on the board and the months your engineers should spend in slovenia .  to conclude ,  i would like to talk about what a joint venture for our companies represents to me and to the management in svn tech .  what are we about to negotiate is a perfect and typical example of a business case about jv in school .  on one hand ,  you are surely concerned about protecting this innovative technology on which you invested not only financial resources ,  but also the hopes for the future of hurm ag .  on the other hand ,  while we are more than willing to commit to this project that represent a huge opportunity for svn tech to grow and expand its capabilities ,  we are equally concerned about engaging in a relationship that could potentially result in a very costly failure .  what i want to say is that i truly believe that we need to overcome our differences and set aside our potential individual gains ,  and if we establish a strong mutual trust  -  starting from this negotiation  -  then i think we can reach the scenario where we create a long - term profitable and functioning relationship .  something that is far better than any alternative hurm or svn may resort to .  i am confident we can come to an agreement ,  and it is going to be a terribly great opportunities for both hurm ag and svn tech ,  best regards ,  sasa novak dear mr .  novak ,  thank you for patientlywaiting on my counteroffer .  please see my counteroffer .  please allow me to illustrate ; without any doubt ,  we have to send some key engineers as it is also in our interest to push the development of the green spirit engine .  however ,  it would be best for us to bring them back as soon as developments have finished .  concerning the payment of the workers , hurm ag is willing to paythe wages of our own staff ,  however ,  we want to suggest svn tech paying for all the slovenian workers .  also , workers and staff specially hired for the joint venture could be paid for in equal terms by us and by your company ,  svn tech . in addition to the basic payment issue ,  an additional compensation is only fair for all slovenian workers involved in this cooperation .  we believe that a compensation of twenty %  is fair . well - paid employees are less induced to be bribed or to leave the firm .  the technological know - how is our key for essential first mover advantage in the future market of the engine industry .  lastly ,  we believe it would be better to rely on a swiss court or a team of arbitrators .  as thisteam of arbitrators is specialised on cross - national cooperation and relies on international standards .  to finalize i would like to stress the fact that this joint venture is very beneficial for both of us ,  so i hope to hear back from you soon and come up with an agreement that both parties feel comfortable with .  kind regards ,  finn mendel dear mr .  mendel ,  i took as well some time to review your counteroffer .  i understand your point of view ,  and on some level i do agree with you ,  although i have some remarks to make .  i do not think that i have to tell you ,  but the early stage of production of a new engine is a complex and delicate phase ,  where usually many issues arise and they need prompt resolution in order to contain the costs .  your engineers will come here exactly because the development is not finished and the situation requires knowledge and assistance that we simply do not have .  also ,  according to our estimations ,  we individuated in nine months the optimal time for your engineers to work in our plants ,  as a whole year would be excessive  ( i . e .  simply more costs )  and half year would not be enough  ( i . e .  to follow the implementation and to reach the required levels of production ).  on the other hand ,  i understand that you will need them to push further your r & d activities ,  and also i would like to tell you that i am well aware of the limited financial resources of hurm .  although svn is already bearing the majority of the costs for providing the human capital and the plants ,  i agree on your proposition of splitting the cost of the commonly hired workers ,  if you accept to keep your engineers here in slovenia for nine months .  another very delicate issue ,  as i explained to you along with my first offer ,  is the number of directors from hurm .  considering the role and the responsibilities of the board ,  it would make more sense to have a majority of svns member ,  because they have the necessary experience and network to deal successfully with the slovenian business environment .  also ,  a very close argument stands with the location of the court of jurisdiction :  the jv will be established here in slovenia ,  ergo the jurisdiction should be the slovenian one .  this would  -  for clear reasons  -  simplify things and make more sense ,  since the activities concerning the production of the engines are going to be carried out here ,  and only the final product will be delivered to switzerland ,  to hurm ags plants located there .  similarly for what concern the hurms engineers moving here for the initial period ,  i understand that hurm is rightfully concerning in protecting its own interest and its revolutionary technology .  that is why i agree on hiring independent arbitrators instead of having the court of jurisdiction either in slovenia or in switzerland ,  and i also agree on giving up the majority of the board to hurm  ( with three directors ).  in exchange for giving you more control over operations carried out here in slovenia ,  and to the more costly of the independent arbitrators that you  -  probably with the same reasoning of mine  -  suggested ,  i am asking you to trust in svn ,  and accept an increase of just ten %  of the compensation of our employees .  i gently remind you that svn is usually not prepared to discuss with external entities any of its internal policy ;  however ,  we can assure you that our workers are very satisfied with the working conditions in general ,  and their wages are already ten %  higher than the average in eastern europe .  therefore you can be sure that there will not be any leakage of your technology ,  on which we also are betting our future on .  please ,  if possible ,  i would like to discuss more in details your issues concerning the additional time your engineers would be spending in svn and the additional compensation for our workers .  these are themes that are very sensible to us ,  and i hope we can better understand each other on these .  of course ,  please be open in sharing what is instead most sensible to hurm ,  i am sure there is no subjects of this negotiation that we cannot solve and get to a good result for everyone .  best regards ,  sasa novak dear mr .  novak ,  thank you for your reply .  i read your suggestions carefully and i would like to make some alterations to your offer .  eventhough it is not ideal ,  we are willing to have our engineers stay an additional six months at the plant in order to resolve any issues that may in the early stages of theproduction of our new engine ,  i hope that this does not affect your suggestion to split the cost of the payment of the common workers in half .  furthermore ,  we belief it is wise to have four members of hurm ag on board as we are an established company with a lot of experience in the field .  this does not mean that we know everything ,  which is where we would really appreciare one person of your company to come in and compansate for this knowledge gap .  we think this is a good distribution for the board .  also ,  we would like to meet you halfway on the compensation of the slovenian workers ,  however please know that we are not willing to settle for anything less than fifteen %.  lastly ,  as i mentioned in my previous correspondation to you ,  we still believe that switzerland would be a better fit for the court of jurisdictionas thisteam of arbitrators is specialised on cross - national cooperation and relies on international standards .  the last two items are of crucial importance to us ,  and are the two items which can make or break this deal .  i hope you bare this in mind .  thank you for your time and i hope to hear back from you soon .  kind regards ,  finn mendel dear mr .  mendel ,  here my offer .  i understand that the additional compensation and the court of jurisdiction are important issues for you .  therefore i decided to agree on your terms on these .  however ,  in exchange i can allow for three hurm directors and additional nine months .  also ,  because of the misundertanding about the court of jurisdictiom ,  i cannot allow for an equal paymetn of the common workers ,  and i ask hurm  -  in exchange for the trust we showing  -  to take this on its shoulder .  best regards ,  sasa novak   \n",

really appreaciate the work of your company ! since several animals have been infected by bse ,  i would like to draw your attention to the urgency to obtain a vaccine . therefore ,  i would like to negotiate with you . most important for us is thedelivery timewhich means we need the vaccine as soon as possbile .  we are open to talk about the price buttwo hundred $  would be in our mind .  can we talk about the guarantee ?  since our company is quite small and unexperienced we would prefer awideguarantee andstandardlevel of future testing . since we are dealing with a very sensitive topic ,  we would appreciate anarrowpublicity .  i am looking forward to hear from youbest regards ,  brown dear brown ,  good morning !  thank you for your email .  i would love to build a business relationship for us !  innovax is a fast - developing pharmaceutical company with advanced vaccine technology .  our vaccines will be extremely helpful for bse trouble .  therefore ,  we would like to chargefive hundredper dose .  i understand your urgent need for delivery time .  however ,  due to a large amount of your order  ( six thousand doses ),  we need more timeseven monthsto ensure the premium quality of innovax vaccine so that you could get the best result for the current bse disaster .  we could offer you anarrowguaranteefor side effects .  if you could consider anunlimitedlevel for future testing ,  that would be great .  your association will become the outstanding animal husbandry pioneer in litulia and worldwide because of future testing !  in the end ,  i would love to agree on thenarrowpublicitysince it is sensitive .  what do you think about the offer ?  let us start our first deal !  i am looking forward to hearing from you .  best regards ,  williams dear williams , thank you very much for your quick response ! i am also very interested and optimistic about a business partnership with innovax and i am sure that we can negotiate a contract that suits both of us .  first of all ,  i am pleased that innovax has such high quality standards .  unfortunately ,  the bse can only be stopped by a vaccine ,  so a delivery timeof seven months is way too long .  i ask you to do everything to achieve a delivery timeof maximum two months .  otherwise wedoubt that we can save our cows . in this case we are open to negotiate the priceand increase our proposal by two hundred $  so that we accept a priceof three hundred $.  i am convinced that innovax is doing an excellent job and will certainly establish itself on the market .  but until then i would kindly ask for a wideguarantee . the welfare of our animals is very important to us ,  so we can only accept astandardlevel of future testing .  last but not least , i am very delighted that we were able to find a common denominator regarding thepublicity . i am very curious about the partnership and looking forward to hear from you ,  william . best regards , brown dear brown ,  thank you for your email .  i really appreciate your trust in innovax !  i understand your urgent situation .  therefore ,  i tried my best to communicate with innovax headquarters for the whole day in order to get a win - win solution for us .  i knew that the delivery time is extremely important to nca .  in order to save more cows '  lives and the local economy ,  our factory could deliver the vaccine faster inthree monthsfor our partnership .  this is the best delivery time we could offer .  but it would cost higher labor ,  material ,  and transportation costs .  therefore i hope you could understand the price offive hundreddollars per dose and unlimitedfuture testing .  this ismy sincerity to you also to local animal farms inlitulia .  at last ,  thewideguarantee is fine with the offers above .  i ' m looking forward to your reply .  best regards  &  stay safe ,  williams dear william ,  thank you for your response !  an agreement often requires concessions from both parties .  therefore i am very pleased with the constructive negotiation . i agree to thedelivery timeof three months ,  thewideguarantee ,  thenarrowpublicityand theunlimitedfuture testing .  nervertheless ,  i would like to ask you ,  if there is there any chance that we can agree on a priceoffour hundred $? i would like to thank you for the excellent negotiation and i am looking forward to future cooperation .  best regards , brown   \n",

dear mr .  williams thank you for your counteroffer .  i have discussed it with my boss .  regarding the price :  she is is only willing to pay  € four hundred per dose when we receive wide guarantee and a delivery in three months .  we are not able to wait longer than that  -  moreover ,  you mention that your recent tests have been very promising .  i am sure with economies of scale you will be able to lower the price in the long - term .  thus ,  for the short - term we would pay  € four hundred and would also be willing to take care of the logistics with preferable incoterms for you .  as such we can ensure three months delivery time  -  for example with some first partial deliveries .  i hope to hear from you soon .  kind regards , ms .  brown dear ms .  brown ,  thank you for your message .  we ' ve discussed your offer internally today .  though a delivery time of three months is quite tight for us as the vaccine is only being mass - produced soon and takes some time to produce ,  we are willing to accept your offer and provide the bse vaccine to your company first .  however ,  we have one minor condition :  we would greatly appreciate if you could publish the results of your vaccination programme to the press as it would be a great manner of spreading awareness of innovax '  new bse vaccine .  i hope to hear from you soon .  kind regards ,  mr .  williams

                                     dear williams ,  what issues are important for you ?  do not hesitate to make me an reasonable offer .  i hope wewill find a satisfactory solution soon !  all the best ,  brown dear brown ,  thank you for messaging me .  as we know the situation in litulia is really bad .  probably all of the cows are infected and we ' re hoping to save as many as possible .  to do that we need help from your company .  each cow needs a dose of vaccine  ( we ' re hoping we can give a vaccine to six thousand cows ).  i ' m gonna be honest the price is really important for us as we need to think about other expenses .  because of that ,  i am proposing the price :  five hundred us dollars per dose .  also time for producing the vaccine and making sure it works will be much longer than you suggested .  we know it should be as fast as possible but to make sure there would be no mistake and that the right amount would be delivered ,  it will take from four to seven months .  tell me what do you think about these issues so we can move on as time is really important here !  kind regards willams dear williams ,  you gave me an offer with two extreme scenarios : pricefive hundred anddelivery timeseven months .  since price anddelivery time is very important for you as it is for me as well ,  i wish to shorten these negotiation by proposing to give and take some of the price and delivery time on both sides .  you prefer future testingstandard ,  so we wish to get guaranteefull to be insured for unforseen events e . g .  new vaccine is not working properly .  all the best ,  brown dear brown ,  when it comes to price and delivery time it is really important for us ..  so i can propose another price ,  four hundred us dollars and delivery time five / six months .  although we can propose a wide guarantee  -  where innovax would cover all damages directly caused by the vaccination .  i ' m waiting for a quick response so we can start producing the vaccine .  all the best ,  williams dear williams ,  i know that the price is very important fory you .  so am i willing to pay you four hundred .  however ,  the delivery time is important for me .  hence ,  i am demanding maximal two months .  to end this unecessary back and fourth game ,  i propose you one last time to jointly maximise our common utility .  instead of only acting self - interested .  guarantee ,  also a very important issue for me ,  would be best for me to get full coverage .  nevertheless ,  i am willing to deal about this issues ,  too .  as you prefer wide publicity ,  i demand full coverage ,  because unlimited publicity is not in our favor .  also ,  you have already demanded standard future testing .  all the best ,  brown dear brown ,  you are right about understanding each other ' s needs ,  but as you know my hand is a little bit tight in some aspects .  we can ' t produce a vaccine in two months with the full guarantee ..  it will be useless for sure .  i still don ' t really understand which aspect is the most important for you .  either you want a vaccine very fast let ' s say two months as you proposed but then our guarantee will be none .  if you want a full guarantee ,  then we need at least six months .  if u agree on the wide one we can do it in four /  five months .  of course ,  we need to test the vaccine so let ' s say we can do it in minimal .  all the best ,  williams with the current terms that we have discussed in the last  \" question \"  message ,  i have an utility slightly above fifty %.  this is not ideal .  however ,  we both should get a fair amount of utility .  with none publicity i get close to sixty %  percent utility .  what about you ?  when we both try to maximise our utility one is going to loose .  so i propose to find a scenario where we both get a fair amount of payout .  cheers ,  brown p .  s .  on my site are no time issues if the time has no difference for you can you check this scenario ?  you ' ll get a full guarantee with no publicity .  because in the one where you proposed three months ,  four hundred ,  full ,  none and standard it ' s not even fifty %  for me and i would like to reach at least this fifty %.  this is also not the best scenario for me but i can accept it as my utility will be fifty %.  preferably i would change the delivery time for five months ..  best ,  williams   \n",

agree on a business as promising as ours !  allow me to put an offer to you which would ,  in our consideration suit the urgency of the situation :  we are willing to offer youstandardtesting in the future as a compensation for the undoubtedly ambitiousone monthdelivery time we need .  taking into account the risk we are taking by considering a vaccination your companyhas not yet tested the vaccine outside the lab before and wecannot know about the quality of the product i am proposingone hundredas compensation for each dose .  this of course includes afullguarantee on it ' s effectiveness and safety .  please note that it is of the utmost importance for both of our parties to not let the wider public be misinformed about our possible business ,  which is why in regards to publicity ,  for the time being ,  we proposenone .  best wishes from sunnylitulia ,  brown dear brown ,  i hope this message finds you well .  we could agree onunlimitedfuture testing ,  so you can benefit from the tests of new medication .  regarding the mentioned risk factor ,  thedelivery timeshould besix monthsin order todecrease the project risk for you and your cattle .  a safe process would benefit the both of us .  the development of the vaccine is quite expensive for us ,  since we are determined to deliver a high quality product .  we suggest apriceoffive hundredus dollars .  we would also offer you anarrowguaranteein which we will compensate for damages caused by gross negligence .  i agree that is is important for both of our parties to not let the wider public be misinformed .  however ,  it would be nice to have narrowpublicity about the new vaccine ,  at least in medical journals .  i am looking forward to your answer !  some aspects can still be discussed further .  kind regards , williams dear williams ,  thank you very much for your counteroffer and kind words .  regarding the urgency of the situation on the ground ,  half a year of waiting ondelivery timefor vaccinations ,  whilst also not having any reasonable guaranteeof it ' s effectiveness is wholly unacceptable .  instead we propose a ramping up of production capacities on your part to make a swift delivery in three monthspossible .  regarding thefullguarantee ,  i ' m afraid that we cannot make any concessions here .  as the proposedunlimitedtesting provides you with a host of opportunities for the future .  we consider this concession to be both an investment in a partnership for the future as well as a massive show of confidence on your company ' s yet to be shown expertise in the field .  we understand the financial strain such a deal would mean for you ,  and are willing to paythree hundredas a meaningful compensation .  if your company is willing to guarantee an even quicker delivery ,  we are of course happy to renegotiate this .  as a second way of showing our willingness to be flexible ,  we would be happy withnarrowpublicity ,  as we understand the importance for a young company to prove it ' s expertise in relevant circles .  thirdly ,  we are best wishes ,  brown dear brown ,  thank you for your message !  we agree with the option of unlimitedfuture testing .  therefore we could make some adjustments and we would offer awideguarantee .  regarding thedelivery time ,  we are willing to offer a quicer solution ,  namely four months .  thisshould be something we can both agree upon ,  so you will receive the vaccines quickly ,  but also safely .  this also plays into the guarantee .  to work with such a quick delivery time ,  we would requestfive hundredus dollars for theprice .  we agree to thenarrowpublicityand are happy we found common ground with you !  is this something you can agree with ?  i think we are getting closer to a great result !  if you are available in the next hours ,  we can discuss things further today .  best wishes , williams dear williams ,  unfortunately ,  i cannot accept your offer as it stands .  however as a concession for a fasterdelivery timeof three monthswe would be willing to offer a further ,  and rather painful concession towidepublicity which is of course a high risk for us .  regarding the price ,  we are willing to offerfour hundred ,  as a wideguarantee still means a considerable financial risk already .  best wishes ,  brown dear brown ,  we are willing to go with awideguaranteeas well .  we can cut down ourdelivery timetothree months ,  which is very ambitious .  for that we will need the priceto be five hundredus dollars . widepublicityis fine with us as well .  just like theunlimitedfuture testing .  altough this offer is really testing our limits ,  we should agree on this deal to benefit both of our organizations and get this terrible situation for

                                          dear williams ,  my name is brown and as you probably know i am working for the nca in litulia .  i am very happy to start negotiations with you and i am hopeful ,  we can find a deal soon .  please find attached my offer .  of course ,  as this is only the start ,  the points are still negotiable .  but please keep in mind that this is a rather urgent matter and i hope we will be able to work quickly on this to find an agreement .  best wishes brown hi mister brown ,  my name is williams and i will be leading the negotiations on behalf of innovax .  likewise do i see opportunities for us to come to a mutual agreement .  indeed ,  time is of the essence which also causes the indicated counteroffer :  quality takes effort and therefore time .  i am looking forward to see your response .  greetings ,  williams dear williams ,  thank you for your fast response .  as i can see from your counteroffer ,  we are definitely on the right track for a good arrangement .  however there are some points ,  that still need to be discussed .  i am pleased to see that we agree onfuture testing .  once we come to an arrangement ,  it would be great to keep our cooperation going .  concerningpublicity ,  i am willing to agree onnarrow ,  since i do understand that this would be a good marketing opportunity for your company .  however more publicity is not an option .  i definitely agree with you and understand that quality takes time .  regardless ,  a seven months delivery timewould just not be feasible .  we are currently in negotiations with other pharmaceutical companies that might be able to deliver more quickly .  since your company would be our favourite cooperation partner and i do understand the issue ,  i would be willing to raise thepricetothree hundred , hoping that this might help you to shorten thedelivery timeat least totwo months .  thank you and best regards brown hi mister brown ,  we are making steps forward which is great !  i am glad we see eye to eye on thefuture testingandpublicitybut there is still some points of discussion .  i too desire our collaboration to keep movind forward now and in the future .  therefore i propose the following .  since our company stands for quality ,  i will uphold the guarantee .  but ,  in order to do so ,  i have to ensure we can make it happen .  resulting in an adequatepriceand we will shorten thedelivery timewith two months .  i understand others are moving too but no one can make it happen like we do .  i hope you consider our porposition .  greetings williams dear williams ,  thank you very much for your counteroffer which already sounds very promising .  i too believe that your company is one of the fastest moving on the market and i have great hopes in your product .  however ,  since you are still a rather young company without reputation and this is only the first phase of testing ,  i must insist on afullguarantee .  i am very happy to see that you could shorten thedelivery time .  if it is possible to shorten it by another two months ,  i am sure we find make a great deal for us both .  because i know that this is a difficult task which takes all your efforts ,  i would be willing to pay the maximumpriceoffive hundred .  thank you and all the best brown hi mister brown ,  good to hear from you again !  i am pleased to see that we are about to close a deal .  i am willing to push our development team to ensure the quickdelivery timeofthree months ,  but it has consequences .  the first step was ,  as you already show , moving forward in perspective of pricewhich i do appreciate and accept .  still ,  i understand your wish for fullguaranteebut due to the push in time ,  unfortunately ,  i can do no more than
